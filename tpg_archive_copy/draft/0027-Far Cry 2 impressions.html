<p>sets the game up to be baldur's gate when its actually diablo<br/>
<br/>
sticks too closely to the shooter mold when it hints at something greater<br/>
<br/>
seemingly quick fixes to gameplay that negates the believability of whatever situation preceded it.  (buddy rescues you in an awesome sequence, then you drive off without a word more dialogue)<br/>
<br/>
bugs - soldiers shooting at me while facing the wrong direction, not noticing as i drive my car up to them<br/>
<br/>
world believability - can't shoot out a window? can't jump over a fence? can't cut a wire fence?<br/>
<br/>
fire/explosions/rockets/mortars = GOOD<br/>
<br/>
africa makes one think of a place where the natural world still is a major threat to humans.  malaria is a start.  but in far cry 2 animals seem to exist solely to run in front of your vehicle and die instantly<br/>
<br/>
some pretty interesting/meaningful moral choices at the end of each chapter, unfortunately the rest of the game seems to be largely devoid of them<br/>
<br/>
use of money - would have been interesting if you could bribe people, buy medicine/food, donate to refugees, or needed to buy ammunition rather than finding it everywhere...  much greater use of resources could have resulted in a more interesting survival situation.  the need for malaria pills was a start in that direction.  but became a predictable situation each time.<br/>
<br/>
where... where are the civilians they reference?  this game was meant to be an rpg-shooter.</p>
