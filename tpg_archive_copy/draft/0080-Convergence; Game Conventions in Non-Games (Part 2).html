"a music site with a decidedly indie slant, songs on TheSixtyOne are uploaded by artists themselves, and voted on by users.  The gimmick?  Whenever a song that you've voted for goes on to be voted for by others, you gain experience and levels.  There are also achievements (such as listen to 1,000 songs) and quests (for example, listen to seven recently posted songs), so you'll always have something to work toward.<br/>

<br/>
all speaks to essentially convergence of media, social networks and games.<br/>
<br/>
what will it mean to have game-like principles defining non-game activities - essentially turning them into games themselves?  what happens when going to the supermarket is a game activity?</p>
