<h2>On Feedback </h2>

<p>About a month or two ago, I decided to read some of the old D&D fantasy that I had been so into as an adolescent. It was horrible in an enjoyable way - <br/>
<br/>
 - got me playing an old gold box TSR game again - one of the krynn ones. <br/>
 - went all the way to the end. considered doing the whole trilogy then came to my senses.<br/>
 - the interesting thing - feedback at a minimum. you only do well or terrible. adherence to d&d rules without allowing for the creative element in pen&paper rpgs made for an immensely frustrating experience. <br/>
<br/>
next level down in feedback intensity - roguelikes.<br/>
<br/>
 - rogue likes are low-feedback intensity games done well. <br/>
once i got over the hump<br/>
  <br/>
it started going fast<br/>
  <br/>
i just fly around those dungeons<br/>
12:19 PM <br/>
and all sorts of tricks start to make themselves evident<br/>
  <br/>
'oh i'll throw a dart at that trap since that guy is standing there'<br/>
  <br/>
'this room looks suspicious, i'll search for pits or come back with a levitation potion'<br/>
  <br/>
and its fast fast fast<br/>
12:23 PM <br/>
and knowing how strength and armor and speed and everything basically works makes decisionmaking fast but still really interesting<br/>
12:24 PM <br/>
been thinking a lot about this stuff - like how the decisionmaking really trumps the minimal visual feedback, and no audio feedback - and how since there's no complex feedback you're more or less free to make decisions as quickly as you can think of them<br/>
12:25 PM <br/>
rather than a game with the exact same mechanics with a really visually complex approach<br/>
  <br/>
lots of world, animation assets<br/>
  <br/>
where you have to immerse in a basic sense of being the avatar in a complex space as well as making decisions<br/>
12:26 PM <br/>
it really is one end of a sort of confusing axis of possibilities for feedback and interaction complexity<br/>
  <br/>
high interaction complexity, almost nil feedback<br/>
12:27 PM <br/>
and thats interesting because thats what games are all about<br/>
  <br/>
processing (human) -> interaction -> processing(computer) -> feedback -> processing (human) etc<br/>
12:29 PM <br/>
its a really interesting balance<br/>
<br/>
so it seems like this new movement of roguelikelikes<br/>
 <br/>
Justin: what now<br/>
 <br/>
me: are trying to maximize both feedback and interaction potential while still keeping it from falling apart<br/>
  <br/>
actually<br/>
  <br/>
stuff like isaac isn't actually rife with interaction potential<br/>
12:40 PM <br/>
its a shooter<br/>
  <br/>
hmm...<br/>
  <br/>
moving and shooting<br/>
  <br/>
spelunky is though<br/>
12:41 PM <br/>
pick up stuff, throw stuff, use items, blow up stuff, interact with people in different ways, pick up people, drop people, use ropes, climb, hover, shoot guns<br/>
12:43 PM <br/>
Justin: sacrifice people</p>
