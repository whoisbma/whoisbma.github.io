straddling the line between creating simulations as models of relevant real-world events, processes, systems, etc; and creating simulations with the goal of compelling, emergent choice making and interactions<br/>

"JT: One of the things about games is that you get to build a model without any consequences or constraints. So Spore in one sense is a very good way of looking at evolution. But, if all things are possible with a certain number of DNA points, and you‚Äôre not constrained by the physical world or what that world would actually provide you, then where do you learn about the consequences of evolution?<br/>
<br/>
WW: Well, when kids‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâor adults‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâplay a game there‚Äôs a model in the computer that they‚Äôre playing against. And when they play they‚Äôre reverse-engineering that model. As they get better at the game, they get a more accurate representation of that computer model. And what I‚Äôve seen in almost every game I‚Äôve made is that when players get a close representation of the model they‚Äôre playing against, they transcend it. They start arguing with the assumptions of that model, saying, ‚ÄúHey, I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs the way cities really work. I don‚Äôt think mass transit‚Äôs really that effective.‚Äù And when they surpass the computer model, it feels to me like they‚Äôre graduating the play experience‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâthey realize this is a toy, not an accurate model of reality.<br/>
<br/>
JT: Okay, so now they‚Äôve got a better idea. How do they put it into effect, if it‚Äôs not already built into the structure of the game?<br/>
<br/>
WW: Well, at that point it becomes really interesting, because if a lot of people are playing the same simulator, they can now have an intelligent debate about how they think it differs from the way the world really works. I think, in some sense, being able to use this imaginary model as a shared landmark helps them actually increase the resolution of their model of the world around them. So building that model in the first place, I think, is a great path to put people on."</p>
