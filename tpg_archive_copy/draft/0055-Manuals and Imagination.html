<h2>Manuals and Imagination</h2>

<p>I seem to have amassed a somewhat large collection of game development related literature that I never get around to reading, but I recently spent a bit of time going through one <em>Beginning Game Level Design</em> by John Feil and Marc Scattergood.  <br/>
<br/>
I'll refrain from commenting There was one area early in the book<br/>
<br/>
"Unfortunately, today's players generally don't read manuals.  For one thing, they aren't very entertaining.  When a player picks up a game he wants to be entertained as soon as possible, so he skips the boring stuff and jumps right into the gameplay.<br/>
Also, manuals these days are expected to fit inside a DVD box, which limits them to 15 or 16 pages.  Even if you do want to provide an entertaining manual, you'll have a bit of a problem fitting a funny bon mot between the necessary pictures of the controller and the credits pages. (You DO want your name in the manual, don't you?)" <br/>

<br/>
first off, makes player sound like an idiot.<br/>
also, not a symptom of changing players as much as a symptom of changing games.<br/>
older console games relied on manuals to set the stage as narrative techniques were not integrated into the game experience itself.<br/>
<br/>
diversity in manuals?  the best example is still the GTA series.<br/>
<br/>
my overall problem with game design books like these is that they essentially teach readers about what goes into making typical, unremarkable games, games that conform to all the cliches and rules about what games are supposed to be. what are they missing?<br/>
<br/>
"Don‚Äôt make paths that fail to reward the player.  If a player follows a path,it <br/>
should lead to somewhere important or something fun to do."  CHRIST i hate this type of thinking.<br/>
<br/>
"As always,only use objects that make sense for the setting.  Palm trees don‚Äôt belong on the tundra,and huge ice stalagmites don‚Äôt belong on tropical islands."  ...Holy crap.  Really?<br/>
<br/>
"You see only a basic semblance of this in-game, but its intent was to call into being a world richer than what was represented. Creators of such games and their related artifacts were in effect building a bridge, from their own creative intent to that of their players ‚Äì or, if you don‚Äôt believe in ‚Äúplayer creativity‚Äù, at least their willingness to engage creatively.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, today technological oneupsmanship drives most of big budget game development towards ever-higher fidelity audiovisuals, in part because that‚Äôs the easiest way to show off the power of new hardware. The aesthetics of many modern games have in turn adapted to embrace this ‚Äì as Epic‚Äôs lead designer Cliff Bleszinski recently pointed out, there are lots of bald space marines with intricate, scuffed metal armor in games today because current graphics hardware is really good at that. Are we really okay with this being the driving force of our medium, though?" -http://vectorpoem.com/news/?p=47</p>
