<p>games for change - the nature is high in scope because not only coming up with original experience or mechanic, but invent them in the context of player engagement that addresses a social issue etc.<br/>
<br/>
understanding games:<br/>
rules and play<br/>
games can be reduced to math<br/>
simplicity and complexity<br/>
<br/>
useful concepts:<br/>
mechanics - atomic unit of games - player action. player user-case.  what are players doing moment to moment, how are they meaningful, how do they add up? - harness what makes games unique<br/>
challenge<br/>
balance - math is a game designer's friend<br/>
<br/>
common pitfalls:<br/>
games as vehicles for entertainment are inefficient (especially in aligning with social games goals etc.)<br/>
learning goals vs. learning the game<br/>
<br/>
gameplay and content:<br/>
simulate your subject<br/>
illustrate your subject<br/>
make the player the subject (focus on the call to action)<br/>
<br/>
the process:<br/>
communication<br/>
iterate - prototype early</p>
