<h2>On being an 'Idea Guy'</h2>

<p>There's a phrase that game industry folks (I'm guilty of this too) tend to quote with either snark or self-satisfaction whenever the topic of the value of creative ideas in games comes up. "Ideas are cheap - execution is what matters." Despite being an incomplete statement, its still essentially true, and useful to keep perspective on how design, and game design specifically, actually works. <br/>
<br/>
It rarely begins with a complete idea, it isn't problem or solution-focused at its core, and problems and solutions emerge together. A single high or low-level idea, executed well, still isn't enough to form a complete picture, and even a "complete" initial mental model isn't enough to carry a project through while remaining unscathed... at least in my experience. Finally, the most common point, that we've all heard before: everyone has ideas - that doesn't make them good.<br/>
<br/>
The flip side is the argument that ideas may be cheap, but <em>good ideas</em> are worth considerably more. Granted. Moving on.<br/>
<br/>
Taking that into account, there is a similarly rocky ground to tread on the topic of being an "idea guy" in the games business. Most these days <br/>
