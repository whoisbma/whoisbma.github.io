<p>not about whether games are good or bad but rather how can they make us better people?<br/>
<br/>
-why are ethics important - what are examples of ethics in games<br/>
if no direction or WHY - its not as much fun.<br/>
protein folding game<br/>
burn victim game (if not for the game they would not survive? really? check up on this)<br/>
<br/>
how to create better spaces for better family communication through family play?<br/>
spaces of family co-entertainment that games can be modeled to better fit?<br/>
spaces for collaboration?  how do you create systems that can allow positive sorts of reinforcement?<br/>
giving kids agency can translate to real life<br/>
<br/>
ethics of representation<br/>
there can be a natural tension/opposition between gameplay and the authenticity of the experience<br/>
does fun trump all considerations? becomes a thornier issue in an educational setting<br/>
what is the responsibility of the designer?<br/>
this is game design plus ... plus... thorny issue<br/>
how to plan for the cost of meeting those responsibilities (as a developer)<br/>
<br/>
games are very good at representing ethical issues<br/>
in-game collaboration are great vehicles for presenting players with ethical choices which they respond to in radically different ways<br/>
how to design games to better encourage ethical behavior?<br/>
<br/>
"for us games are not toys" - "but at the end of the day, it's just a game - compelling entertainment experience"<br/>
do companies have a responsibility not to make people uncomfortable?  <br/>
<br/>
being uncomfortable can lead to reflection which can lead to ethical thinking?<br/>
perfectly valid for games to make people uncomfortable?<br/>
<br/>
companies have 3 constituents<br/>
- shareholders - want profitable<br/>
- public - want fun<br/>
- employees - want meaningful<br/>
<br/>
games as transgressive experiences?  exploratory spaces?<br/>
<br/>
line between ethics in games and ethics in the real world are an imaginary construction?<br/>
<br/>
ethics is contextual -  shouldn't equate players moral behavior with their moral behavior in the real world.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
MY question about ethics and game design - ethics as presentation of SYSTEMS in mainstream games.  not much more.<br/>
ethical choice in games as an illusory construct?<br/>
ethical choice in a game seems meaningful on outset but later becomes evident as a simple game design tool, same as the rest of the presentation of the systems which make up the game features<br/>
players develop a sense for working with the systems presented in different ways coming out as gameplay<br/>
in the case of bioshock - the ethical choice is largely an illusion - <br/>
player experience of game ethics is just an extension of player exploration of game systems.<br/>
