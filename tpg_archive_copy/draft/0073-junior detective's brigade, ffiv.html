<p>junior detectives' brigade - first louis, then rosa<br/>
narrative fallacy - something about being human that gives us this inclination.  and yet something about it is so satisfying when we're actually proven right.  hotel dusk's story is an exercise in extraordinary coincidences of conjoining mysteries.<br/>
games have a tendency to telegraph their design - that is show the player that the game was made for them.  in short, not a real world.  it is rare when a game this linear can actually not feel this way and yet for some reason have all the elements in place that make this so common in other games.  here, a mystery unfolds, hunches end up bearing fruit.  its because the story is just that well crafted, not about a gameplay element feeling contrived.  "can't be a dead-end, that has no purpose, from the design perspective!" - has no meaning here.<br/>

ffiv - king baron is a war hawk!!<br/>
it being election season in the states, i find myself drawing comparisons between ffiv on DS and the administration of the last 8 years.<br/>
also - the half breed ends up getting to be king!<br/>
did some great work on the cutscenes.<br/>
always been thematically compelling (the dark side of people, to beat your dark side you must forgive it, redemption in forgiveness) for me, despite the plot device of "mind control" being a bit... unsophisticated.<br/>
