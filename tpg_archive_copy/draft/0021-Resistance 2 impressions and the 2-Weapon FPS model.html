<p>So I meant to publish this back months ago, when my memory of playing through Resistance 2 was fresher in my mind, but I'll indulge in this bit of complaining anyway.  <br/>
<br/>
Overall I felt It seems some of the biggest praise was for the multiplayer, which I didn't indulge in, so I time ago.<br/>
<br/>
The 2-Weapon model was popularized, I believe, by Halo and other games of that era.  One of the reasons it worked so well was<br/>
It's interesting to see how quickly that model falls apart when weapons <br/>
<br/>
character models - good.  (monsters, etc) environment models - less good.  (bad texture seams in places, transitional textures, scale issues  - however some "wow" vista moments ie SF vista, certain giant monsters)<br/>
<br/>
problems:<br/>
weapons mechanic - some secondary fire modes are fun, some seem arbitrary.  <br/>
weapons placement - the game uses the 2-weapon + grenades max arsenal model, which has become something of a standard.  the purpose of the model is to encourage more strategic thinking<br/>
inconsistent control over environment - sometimes arbitrary triggers (elevators start when you enter them) vs. button pressing, etc.<br/>
out of body cinematic triggers - is camera hale's viewpoint or not?  inconsistent<br/>
mechanical loops to giant monsters.  at first - WOW!  then... oh.  two loops...  reminiscent of early 90s games boss patterns.  learn the pattern, easy!  in that its old school - cool but there's no feeling of life to these creatures, which is more jarring in the fact that they look so incredible.  compare to shadow of the colossus... fairly simple patterns but so much more effective and lifelike.  the one exception is the giant guy that throws you through a building.  kewl.</p>
