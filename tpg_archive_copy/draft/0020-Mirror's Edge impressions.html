<h2>Mirror's Edge impressions</h2>

<p>I just finished the story mode in Mirror's Edge (2008) on PS3 after playing it for the last few days.  Overall I was fairly impressed with the experience.  This might have been due to lowered expectations after slightly less than excellent scores.<br/>
i tend to be very happy with highly polished minimalism in games and my response to the game is probably an expression of that.<br/>
<br/>
the "Portal model"<br/>
austere, bare, minimal presentation and environments<br/>
essentially environmental puzzles - use the tools you have to get from point A to point B (tools here are limited to the laws of physics, ostensibly)<br/>
minimal combat - running from combat essentially feels like the first half hour of half life 2 (a very good thing)<br/>
breathtaking moments/adrenaline (desperate leaps, running for your life)<br/>
trial and error<br/>
occasionally multiple ways of problem solving<br/>
"ethnic" female protagonist<br/>
the ending credits even play a song titled "Still Alive"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
differences: <br/>
portal: gameplay driven narrative<br/>
ME: character driven narrative<br/>
