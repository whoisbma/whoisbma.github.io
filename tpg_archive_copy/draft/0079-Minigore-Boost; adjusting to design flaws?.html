<h2>Minigore/Boost; adjusting to design flaws?</h2>

<p>As a designer currently working on and researching iPhone games, I have an fairly sizable collection of paid apps sitting in my iTunes library, waiting for my attention.  My iPod Touch is filled to the brim with games to research; my iPhone as well.<br/>
<br/>
When I'm outside of the working/research frame of mind however, I find that I stick to a surprisingly few amount of (arguably) timewaster-type games.  <br/>
<br/>
The exception to this rule of course is the sublime <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/browserRedirect?url=itms%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252FWebObjects%252FMZStore.woa%252Fwa%252FviewSoftware%253Fid%253D324563544%2526mt%253D8">Civilization Revolution</a> for iPhone!  <br/>
<br/>
Er... full disclosure, I worked on this one.  That will be the last shameless plug for this game, I promise.  In this post.<br/>
<br/>
For the last few months, when I'm on the metro, in a cab, on the can, whatever - I usually have found myself gravitating towards <a href="http://bit.ly/download-minigore">Minigore </a>and <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/browserRedirect?url=itms%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252FWebObjects%252FMZStore.woa%252Fwa%252FviewSoftware%253Fid%253D333191476%2526mt%253D8%2526partnerId%253D30%2526partnerId%253D30%2526siteID%253DGq7D5Ffi.rQ-1A84NlbrYz7KTZVKhHRiig">Boost</a>.<br/>
<br/>
It's not just me; these games are huge - highly rated, lots of downloads, "Best of" lists...<br/>
