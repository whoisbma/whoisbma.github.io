<h2>G4C Festival - Money and Meaning</h2>
<h4>2009-05-29 03:43:41</h4>
<h4>status: draft</h4>
<h4>author: Bryan</h4>
<p>Seth Schiesel from NYT talking about games being prime movers these days - but no corresponding change in exploring deeper concepts in commercially successful games.   then referencing the DIVIDE between this group (G4C) and commercial - proud dilettantism.  walling away, ivory tower.  what we want is an integration - doing well by doing good. syriana, bob dylan, bruce springsteen - particular social agenda but also tremendously commercially successful.  is g4c preaching to the choir?  so how do we reach the broader audience.  commercial industry is interested in making money first and foremost.  music / movie industry has realized you can make a lot of money with entertainment products that also have a good social point.  <br/>
<br/>
Larry Goldberg - Activision 10 yrs etc, studio heads<br/>
Sharon Knight - former EA executive - corporate finance etc., most recently running global dev division<br/>
Alan Gershenfeld - Activision - now new company wanting to make profitable social issue games<br/>
Lucy Bradshaw - EA Maxis (me = starstruck!)<br/>
<br/>
SS: Why haven't we seen this melding within the industry?<br/>
LG: a lot of change in the industry right now.  required to look at all the possible ways to take advantage of platform opportunities. <br/>
SK: major transformations in the industry. new models are arising that are making new possibilities<br/>
AG: distribution methods are the big change.  barriers to entry were high, now boundaries are lowering and blurring in multiple ways.<br/>
LB: open apis.  apple/flash etc. changed landscape of development.<br/>
<br/>
SS: but why have commercially viable games run screaming away from games that have something to do with the real world?  pretty atypical of other media forms based on the lifespan so far.  willful escapism in games?  fear of offending audience by having a point of view?<br/>
LG: big publishers say: who's the audience?  historically young men.  .... not everything in games is killing people though.<br/>
LB: simcity3000 story - publisher befuddlement in reaction to pitch.  "this will sell how?"  but it did, a lot.  roles in the industry only expanding now, also.  as an immature industry, these are some of the issues that are now coming to the fore now.<br/>
AG: very young medium.  games, developers and gamers are literally maturing.  anyway some of the dynamics are changing.<br/>
SK: game industry going through its own challenges<br/>
LB: another major shift - entertainment software programs in academia.  this is a major change.  these people are also highly idealistic and looking at things outside of the typical shooter, which is changing the hiring landscape as well.<br/>
<br/>
SS: is the core audience not ready for an infusing of values or issues into say an otherwise typical genre type game?  i.e. we'll give action, but ALSO here's THIS...<br/>
LB: there have been attempts on bringing in movie elements on commercially viable games.  storytelling aspect will improve along with production values and <br/>
AG: Middleware has really enabled people to explore this more on their own, which led to things like Portal.<br/>
LG: someone has to take the lead, and someone will take the lead.  in the movies, they took elements of star power and branding to wrap around those causes.<br/>
<br/>
SS: what do you think the people in this room could/should be doing to encourage the commercial game industry to go after these causes<br/>
AG: a desire to do it - much of G4C doesn't desire to go for a commercial model (good for some but some should) - by going for a commercial model, you HAVE to make it fun.  have to take a portfolio approach.  iterate.<br/>
<br/>
SS: is there something fundamental about the dynamics of gameplay that encourages people to have an escapist approach?  is it something makes games antithetical to serious concepts?<br/>
LB: army's training games are an example of how that doesnt apply.  theres something very important about play - experience of being able to experiment, explore, find boundaries/failure/success states - therefore play has value.  but can we take play and move it into something that transcends the game itself.<br/>
<br/>
SS: no "morality" in a sandbox - ie functional vs. dysfunctional families in sims2.  military vs. cultural victory in civilization.  <br/>
<br/>
LB: there are ways to bring both exploration (traditional gaming experience) with promoting a particular cause or viewpoint.  (...how?)<br/>
<br/>
AG: Will Wright - often the most memorable things are negative.  blade runner scenario - evocative scenes of urban planning gone wrong.  the message and the content doesnt have to carry everything.  <br/>
<br/>
SS: where do you think the greatest opportunities are?<br/>
LB: gaming practices in the "real world" - achievement score for conservation etc.  monitor energ<br/>
SS: a "point" to games. is it polemicism?  is there something at odds with the nature of gameplay?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
makes me think about the clear divide of the people here:  the visionaries/artists/academics and the movers/shakers.</p>
