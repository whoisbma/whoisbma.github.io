this talk went so fast - very little time spent on actual production processes.  Brenda Brathwaite rushed us through some basics and things to remember at the end but there was almost no time spent on it considering how deep the subject is and how tough software development/production.  most of the talk was dedicated to primarily looking at examples<br/>
