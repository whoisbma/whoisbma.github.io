<h4>author: Bryan</h4>
<p>it seems that there is such a rift between what people are talking about and working on here among this community/movement with the mainstream game development scene.<br/>
pretty limited perspective on production - intended for a non-development audience<br/>
the highest respected academics and game designers in this field have for the most part a minimal experience in the mainstream - why?  what's going on here?<br/>
so many people here from mixed disciplines and backgrounds - but the rift seems too wide for them to cross over to mainstream gamers or other<br/>
everybody's talking about will wright etc..  there aren't any will wrights in this field yet.</p>
