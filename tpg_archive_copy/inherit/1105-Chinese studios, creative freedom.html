<h2>Chinese studios, creative freedom</h2>

<p>Several months back I had a chance to sit down with Wesley Bao of <a href="http://www.coconutislandstudio.com/">Coconut Island</a> at their office in downtown Shanghai. They hosted Shanghai's Global Game Jam earlier this year and I was intrigued by their approach and values as an indie studio - they seemed to set Wesley and his colleagues apart from the vast majority of the game development scene across China.<br/>
<br/>
Coconut Island is odd for a homegrown studio - they target the international market almost exclusively, avoiding the Chinese market wherever they can. Is this the only way to have a "creative" independent studio in China?<br/>
