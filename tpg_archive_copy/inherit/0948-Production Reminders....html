<br/>
<strong>Shit happens:</strong><br/>
<br/>
     The majority of games in development come in later than the developers originally intended.  Reasons include: <br/>
<br/>
     Murphy's Law - Assume Murphy's Law is the most consistent natural phenomenon of game development - be aware of it and prepare for it in planning.<br/>
<br/>
     Developer overconfidence.<br/>
<br/>
     To attract publishers to take on the project, developers want to impress on them the best case scenario regarding brevity of development time and minimal funding.<br/>
<br/>
     Being a creative process, development could stretch on forever if one lets it.  The graphics could always be better.  The gameplay and feature set could always be more fine tuned.  The technology could always be improved.  The producer's responsibility is to draw the line.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Don't give in to pressure or guilt:</strong><br/>
<br/>
     It is your job to make commitments on deliveries since you know your team, their capabilities, and their track record, better than anyone.  <br/>
<br/>
     There are three critical factors that come into play when making delivery commitments - quality, cost, and schedule.  The trade off between these three factors is a critical decision that producers must make, and make often.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Tracking documents are just tools but judgments must be made on multiple factors:<br/>
</strong><br/>
     Tracking tools are just that, tools, no more.  Although they must be used to keep processes in order and everything under control, other factors must always be considered.  Tracking documents are not enough, no matter how immaculate.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Simplify:<br/>
</strong><br/>
     When things aren't going right or get off track, simplify.  Rather than add resources, simplify.  Adding resources will likely complicate matters and get you more off track.<br/>
<br/>
     When communicating, simplify.  Verbosity and expansive vocabulary are not virtues in communicating to get things done.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Team spirit is crucial:</strong><br/>
<br/>
     Everyone on your team is important.  Don't work only with leads or the people you get along with the best.  Earn respect by being fair, enthusiastic, sensitive to others' needs, and help each and every person when they need it.  Team building is crucial social engineering for game development and open communication is the key.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>A formula for success: 30% Foresight + 70% Insight + 0% Hindsight</strong><br/>
<br/>
     If its screwed up, no sense dwelling on it.  Just take action to fix it, repair the damage, or cut your losses.  Use the experience gained to mitigate other similar problems and risks in the future.<br/>
 <br/>
     Regarding the importance of planning ahead for risks: "A whole year's work depends on a good start in Spring.<br/>
