Noisrucker was the Global Game Jam 2012 entry by Glen Forrester, Daniel Baker, and B-Ma. It was based on the theme of Ouroboros - the age-old symbol of the snake consuming itself - and was built at the Sydney Game Jam site in under 48 hours. It won "Best Tech" and was also nominated for "Best Use of Theme." Neat.<br/>
<br/>
Glen was primarily responsible for making this unusual bit of conceptual gameplay happen, while Daniel Baker provided some incredible Aphex Twin-esque, atmospheric sound.<br/>
<br/>
Its an odd game, this one. We decided to try something related to the idea of recursion that the Ouroboros seems to suggest, and ended up referring to an old Perry Bible Fellowship comic that I remembered, by Nicholas Gurewitch:<br/>
