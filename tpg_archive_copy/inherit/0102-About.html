<strong>The Pretentious Gamer</strong> is ...<br/>
<br/>
... authored by two brothers and upstart game developers who haven't yet earned the right to think we're so great.  But we do, anyway.<br/>
<br/>
... about reconciling self-righteous pretension with overwhelming, debilitating dorkiness.<br/>
<br/>
... about fighting against our our deeply ingrained games-apologist tendencies and view the industry and its products critically.<br/>
<br/>
... about finding and examining our place as young, cog-in-the-machine game developers.<br/>
<br/>
... about celebrating what's great about what games, and making them.</p>
