<h2>TGS 2009</h2>

<p>Just visited Tokyo for the first time for Tokyo Game Show.  My branch was being represented by just two of us, in place of my boss. <br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately I was much too busy to really spend much time with games at the show itself - I was mostly running around like a maniac.  I'll refrain from commenting much on the show itself.  Although I have to say I was very struck by Inafune's comments on the state of the Japanese game industry:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><a href="http://www.destructoid.com/tgs-09-keiji-inafune-dumps-on-tokyo-game-show-2009-149909.phtml">"Personally when I looked around [at] all the different games at the TGS floor," Capcom's Ben Judd translated Inafune, "I said 'Man, Japan is over. We're done. Our game industry is finished.'"</a></blockquote><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
For many people Japan does represent the past of the games industry.  But there are better places to read about this assessment than here.  So what's the future of the industry?  China and Korea?  I work in a Shanghai branch of a US publisher, but I'm not ready to agree with that sentiment just yet.<br/>

One other note... when you've seen cartoon versions of a city your whole life, it can get a little surreal to see the real place.</p>
