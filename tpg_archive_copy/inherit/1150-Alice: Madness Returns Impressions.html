<p>Shanghai-based game creator American McGee and his studio Spicy Horse have just completed work on Alice: Madness Returns, a dark re-imagination of the classic Lewis Carroll story and the anticipated sequel to American McGee's Alice.<br/>
<br/>
Alice, released in 2000, had players diving into a macabre, dangerous Wonderland as a teenaged, gothy, loony Alice. She spends most of the game wielding a kitchen knife and looking crazed, while fending off the twisted inhabitants of an alternate Wonderland. Madness Returns brings us back into her psychosis as we try to keep Alice alive and sane.<br/>
<br/>
In some ways, Alice 2 feels dated, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. Gameplay centers on platforming-focused level design, 3D lock-on combat, and item collection - nothing new, but also solidly designed and appealingly nostalgic.<br/>
<br/>
There are some modern touches. A now common gameplay trend has players discovering voice recordings from characters in the world as they progress, building a sense of place and history. In Madness Returns, you retrieve Alice's memories of conversations past - a nice Eternal Sunshine-esque spin on the idea. She sifts through memories in Wonderland as her psychiatrist in London hypnotizes her to forget.<br/>
<br/>
The real star is the art. The original Alice was known for surreal dreamscapes and Alice 2 maintains the tradition. The game begins in a stylized Victorian London that feels too familiar to be especially memorable, but soon you're tumbling into Wonderland and the manifestations of Alice's madness. The vivid views down the rabbit hole are a pleasure to behold. Transitioning from one area to the next almost feels too sudden; I found myself wanting to see more of what each landscape had to offer.<br/>
<br/>
Some might find Madness Returns to be heavy-handed or conventionally morbid, and admittedly it isn't much of a stretch to put a dark, violent twist on what is already vaguely menacing source material. The last ten years have given us experimental, subtly terrifying games like Tale of Tales' also fable-based The Path, and it might have been nice to see some similarly nuanced ambiguity in Alice's narrative.<br/>
<br/>
Mr. McGee and Spicy Horse have left a mark with a solid, aesthetically beautiful experience - Alice: Madness Returns does its predecessor proud. Nice work from our fellow Shanghai denizens - give it a spin if you feel like stepping through the ol' looking glass.</p>
