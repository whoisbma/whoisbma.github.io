<p><a href="http://minecraft.net/">Minecraft</a> effectively distills the fundamental(?) human instinct to reshape the natural environment - it is the essence, the good stuff, everything else stripped away.<br/>
<br/>
For those who've been completely out of the loop and not heard of it - it is an unequivocal phenomenon.  This game deserves so many more words just on its own merits as a game.  I will attempt to do some justice to it in a later post.<br/>
<br/>
This video and talk here is a fantastic piece of work, putting Minecraft into context with architectural and artistic concepts of utopia as well as the changes that augmented reality can enact in how we exist and interact in physical spaces. <br/>

<blockquote>"So while some trends in architecture and urbanism promotes computation as a tool for mindless form-making, that lends itself as much to the design of shoes as it does to the design of cities, I instead see an opportunity to increase both our computational and spatial literacies, to enhance our ability to read and write; to program spaces, and the machines that interact with them."</blockquote><br/>
