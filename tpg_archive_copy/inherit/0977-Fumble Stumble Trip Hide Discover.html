Beacons of Hope is a quaint-sounding name for a game, especially for something as ostensibly esoteric and experimental as this one, but it resonates meaningfully with the actual game experience. <br/>
<br/>
The short version of how it works is this: you stumble around in complete darkness with a dozen or so similarly hapless participants, tripping on obstacles and groping on the floor, while flashes of red light briefly illuminate the "monsters" as they stalk and eliminate other players one by one. If players can find three hidden artifacts, each of which can flood the space with blinding white light, they can vanquish the monsters and win the round. Melodic and dissonant sounds accompany the movements and actions of the monsters and the artifacts. It's creepy, confounding, and occasionally thrilling.<br/>

I had a chance to play J.S. Joust last summer, and its ingenious to say the least. It takes a reference point in traditional folk games, and repurposes modern game interfaces and technology - artifacts we're familiar with as game players - to tap into those more fundamental, more <em>ancestral</em> tropes of play. There is no screen for the game system to communicate feedback - communication from system to player only takes place through controller vibration, light, and music. The game encourages players to focus not on the system itself but rather the social experience of actively negotiating it. <br/>

<br/>
J.S. Joust does away with conventional video game necessities while appropriating and "disenchanting" the bare minimum remainder required to still look at play through the lens of a "video game". Now when I say play, I'm talking play as in humanistic play, mammalian play, childhood play, the kind of play that sits deep in our genetic memory, next to our experience of music and other primal-feeling phenomenon. This kind of play is less strategic, less systems-oriented, but physical, social, emotional, <em>confrontational</em>. Joust subverts modern game apparatuses, in this case PlayStation Move controllers, in order to position them within a <em>new-old</em> context of play. <br/>
<br/>
Beacons of Hope does essentially the same thing as J.S. Joust. PS Move controllers are the "beacons" that players hunt for as well as the monsters' crucial accessory; they flash ominously as they scramble to grab players, taking them out of the game, while sound responding to their movement plays in the background. Since the game is played in complete darkness, every bit of light illuminates the surrounding area instantly.<br/>

<br/>
Once in Shanghai I ate at a "dark" restaurant. This meant that the dining area was in complete darkness, as in 1,000-feet-under-the-earth pitch-black. We were led to our seats by blind waiters, hands on each others' shoulders, then sat down to fumble with our utensils. We would invariably end up eating with our hands before finally being led out again.<br/>
<br/>
That restaurant didn't survive more than a year or two, which is telling - if it had still been around later on, I certainly wouldn't feel the need to go back. Despite its gimmicky angle, it was worthwhile in that it was interesting to experience the sensation of being completely blinded, especially while taking in the smells, touches and tastes of an otherwise ordinary dining experience. We were temporarily forced to interact with the food and each other in ways that were entirely dependent and incapable.<br/>
<br/>
During the playtest of Beacons of Hope, I felt incapacitated in similar ways. I fumbled on the floor, bumped into chairs and other players; I felt defenseless and exposed. The knowledge that someone was out there hunting for us was eerie, despite the fact that they were, for the most part, as blind as we were. <br/>
<br/>
Doug and his colleagues describe "abusive" game design as "refram(ing) gameplay as a dialogic relation between player and designer â€“ a kind of conversation that presents itself in the form of a dare." The design of the game was "abusive" in the sense that we were taken abruptly out of our comfort zone in a distinctly physical way. It was meant to disrupt, yet enthrall.<br/>
<br/>
I started at the sound of footsteps, I huddled behind what seemed to be an obstacle that would protect me; I hid in the corner, flattening myself against the wall. A light would flash from across the room, the sound of the monster's controllers would intensify, and I would scramble away. This experience was about helplessness first and foremost, and reactions based on sudden visceral stimuli. <br/>
<br/>
Then something amazing happened - I actually stumbled across one of the beacons in my blindness, and immediately felt a surge of adrenaline. After a moment's hesitation, I held it over my head, and pressed the button. A clear, penetrating note as from a bell sounded as my controller vibrated in my hand. I could see everything in a 15 foot radius. Two other players, groping on their hands and knees, looked up at me, startled. So did the nearest monster, who came for me immediately. Oops.<br/>

<br/>
In following games, other players were smarter than I and illuminated their beacon only for an instant, immediately moving away. At one point I felt the impulse to immediately place myself between a lit beacon and an illuminated monster. <br/>
<br/>
I heard one, and then two melodies intertwining over the sound system, indicating as many beacons had been found. They cautiously flashed their controllers, then suddenly the third was found, they realized we had won and ran to each other, beacons flashing. We applauded. It was dramatic.<br/>

<br/>
We played for a few hours, discussing alterations of the rules as well as possibilities for the space. The game wasn't set in stone or complete, and many fundamental rules were open to discussion. Though we seemed to be striving for an ideal "completed" Beacons of Hope, the uncertainty of it all invited comparisons to Doug and co.'s ideas on "broken" or self-effacing games - inviting "physical and subversive play, hinting to and even telling the players that the terms of the game are up for debate."<br/>
<br/>
The game was not perfect, and its hard to imagine a situation in which it could be so. Some dissonance seems inevitable, and even central to the experience of the game. In a way, the dissonance felt almost enriching, though occasionally frustrating. <br/>
<br/>
There is a lot of stuff going on behind this game. As with Doug's previous work, Beacons of Hope is part of a conversation on play as a dialogic relationship, and is also a participant in a movement of  democratic technology. It rejects some of the ideas of ubiquitous computing - that which states that our future will be a deluge of screens and interfaces and networked everything - in favor of the personal, social, and emotional, moving us away from the tech and ba - <a href="http://doougle.net/articles/Abusive_Game_Design.pdf">"remind(ing) us that play is, above all, something personal"</a> - and accessible.</p>
