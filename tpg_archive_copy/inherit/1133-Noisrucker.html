Noisrucker was the Global Game Jam 2012 entry by Glen Forrester, Daniel Baker, and B-Ma. It was based on the theme of Ouroboros - the age-old symbol of the snake consuming itself - and was built at the Sydney Game Jam site in under 48 hours. It won "Best Tech" and was also nominated for "Best Use of Theme." Neat.<br/>
<br/>
Its an odd game, this one. We decided to try something related to the idea of recursion that the Ouroboros seems to suggest, and ended up referring to an old Perry Bible Fellowship comic, by Nicholas Gurewitch:<br/>

In Noisrucker, you play as an object navigating a level, except that you are also the level, and the level is you. This means that it is your own surface that you are navigating, as your own surface is being navigated by you. The only way to extend your life is to cut away at your own surface, revealing the life-giving stuff hidden within your own body.<br/>
<br/>
The beams that damage your structure do not simultaneously affect all of your 'versions.'  The only way to get to the good stuff once you've damaged yourself is to find a portal somewhere on your surface, "descend" an iteration of yourself, and become the smaller version of you that was previously navigating your own structure. At this point the damage becomes apparent and you are able move within your own body to consume yourself, extending your life.<br/>
<br/>
Glen was responsible for making this unusual bit of conceptual gameplay happen, while Daniel Baker provided some incredible Aphex Twin-esque, atmospheric sound.<br/>
