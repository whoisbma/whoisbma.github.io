<strong><font size="+2">The Pretentious Gamer</strong> is ...</font><br/>
<br/>
<strong>... authored by two brothers and upstart game developers who haven't earned the right to think we're so great.  But we do, anyway.<br/>
<br/>
... about reconciling self-righteous pretension with overwhelming, debilitating geekiness.<br/>
<br/>
... about fighting against our our deeply ingrained games-apologist tendencies and viewing the industry critically.<br/>
<br/>
... about finding and examining our place as young, cog-in-the-machine game developers.<br/>
<br/>
... full of opinions that are solely our own and not those of our employers.  Thank you for employing us, employers.<br/>
<br/>
... about celebrating what's great about what games, and making them.</strong><br/>
