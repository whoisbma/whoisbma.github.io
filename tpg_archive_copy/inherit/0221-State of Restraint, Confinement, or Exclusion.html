<p>Limbo = fantastic experience.  not as memorable as a "game" per se but very notable for its nearly Portal or Braid-like cerebral challenges without incorporating necessarily mind-bending mechanics.<br/>
sound and visuals incredible<br/>
felt a direct link to chahi games - the quiet, the danger, the menace, the inevitability.<br/>
a weak conclusion - the human element of the danger was by far the most memorable.  your peers trying to murder you.  followed by the natural world - the spider was terrifying.  finally the mechanical, the man-made - this was least affecting.  but it was solely the man-made that dominated the third act.<br/>
there is something much more deeply disturbing in the lord of the flies-like cruelty and society hinted at in the forts and constructions of the other children - a place where you were distinctly "the other". <br/>
the systematic, the predictable, the inevitable behavior of the mechanisms of the third act made the most sense for ramping up the gameplay challenges - but they remain very inhuman.  a combination of the human and the mechanical, in some way, may have made for a more compelling conclusion.<br/>

augustine (his title of "saint" i would prefer to not acknowledge) wrote:<br/>
"such infants as quit the body without being baptized will be involved in the mildest condemnation of all. That person, therefore, greatly deceives both himself and others, who teaches that they will not be involved in condemnation; whereas the apostle says: 'Judgment from one offence to condemnation' (Romans 5:16), and again a little after: 'By the offence of one upon all persons to condemnation' (Romans 5:18)."</p>
