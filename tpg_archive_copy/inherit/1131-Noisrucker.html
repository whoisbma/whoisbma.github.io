Noisrucker was the Global Game Jam 2012 entry by Glen Forrester, Daniel Baker, and B-Ma. It was based on the theme of Ouroboros - the age-old symbol of the snake consuming itself - and was built at the Sydney Game Jam site in under 48 hours. It won "Best Tech" and was also nominated for "Best Use of Theme." Neat.<br/>
<br/>
Its an odd game, this one. </p>
