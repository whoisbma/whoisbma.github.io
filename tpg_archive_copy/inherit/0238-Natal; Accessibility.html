<h2>Natal; Accessibility</h2>

<p>A thought as I messed around with the Kinect the other day.  Making games "accessible" usually has two not altogether distinct connotations; one being to make games more mass-audience-friendly, and the other to make games playable for those with physical or other disabilities - in essence, the opposite of mass audience.  <br/>
<br/>
The Wii was one of the first major efforts that people associate with making games more accessible in the first sense, and now Kinect and Move are making their mark as well, to say nothing of the masses spending their time on social web-games.<br/>
<br/>
The second sense is a bit more tricky<br/>
<br/>
These two connotations are not disparate, as the main purpose of both is to increase the maximum potential audience for the product.<br/>
<br/>
... what does input hardware like this mean for accessibility?<br/>
<br/>
Making games "accessible" usually has two separate implications.<br/>

Step 1: As you stand in front of the camera, it judges the distance to different points on your body. In the image on the far left, the dots show what it sees, a so-called "point cloud" representing a 3-D surface; a skeleton drawn there is simply a rudimentary guess. (The image on the top shows the image perceived by the color camera, which can be used like a webcam.)<br/>
Step 2: Then the brain guesses which parts of your body are which. It does this based on all of its experience with body poses‚Äîthe experience described above. Depending on how similar your pose is to things it's seen before, Natal can be more or less confident of its guesses. In the color-coded person above [bottom center], the darkness, lightness, and size of different squares represent how certain Natal is that it knows what body-part that area belongs to. (For example, the three large red squares indicate that it‚Äôs highly probable that those parts are ‚Äúleft shoulder,‚Äù ‚Äúleft elbow‚Äù and ‚Äúleft knee"; as the pixels become smaller and muddier in color, such as the grayish pixels around the hands, that‚Äôs an indication that Natal is hedging its bets and isn‚Äôt very sure of its identity.)<br/>
Step 3: Then, based on the probabilities assigned to different areas, Natal comes up with all possible skeletons that could fit with those body parts. (This step isn't shown in the image above, but it looks similar to the stick-figure drawn on the left, except there are dozens of possible skeletons overlaid on each other.) It ultimately settles on the most probable one. Its reasoning here is partly based on its experience, and partly on more formal kinematics models that programmers added in.<br/>
Step 4: Once Natal has determined it has enough certainty about enough body parts to pick the most probable skeletal structure, it outputs that shape to a simplified 3D avatar [image at right]. That‚Äôs the final skeleton that will be skinned with clothes, hair, and other features and shown in the game.<br/>
Step 5: Then it does this all over again‚Äî30 times a second! As you move, the brain generates all possible skeletal structures at each frame, eventually deciding on, and outputting, the one that is most probable. This thought process takes just a few milliseconds, so there's plenty of time for the Xbox to take the info and use it to control the game.<br/>
