<h2>Gamasutra recognition</h2>

<p>Just a quick post to thank the editors at Gamasutra for selecting two blog entries of mine as their <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=25059">favorite user posts of the week</a>.  It was quite a surprise as I just began reposting some entries on my Gamasutra user page and certainly didn't expect any recognition.  Gamasutra editors, thanks again - and also thanks to all the users who commented as well.<br/>
<br/>
Since coming back to work, I can see how much energy it takes to maintain a regular posting rhythm - even compared to my sporadic posting on sabbatical.  When I commented about a topic that I felt he should write about, Justin said in so many words that when he spends the majority of his workday writing game documents, coming home and writing MORE about games seems like a tall order.  The truth of that statement notwithstanding, we'll do our best to continue to try to improve the quality and consistency of content here.<br/>
<br/>
Now on to empty my wallet!</p>
