Beacons of Hope is a quaint-sounding name for a game, especially one as ostensibly esoteric and experimental as this one, but it is accurate in something of an original manner and resonates meaningfully with the actual game experience. <br/>
<br/>
The short version of how it works is this: you stumble around in complete darkness with a dozen other people, while flashes of red light and frightening sounds briefly illuminate the "monsters" as they stalk and eliminate other players one by one. If players can find three hidden artifacts, each of which can flood the space with blinding white light, they can vanquish the monsters and win the round. It's creepy, confounding, and occasionally thrilling.<br/>

Doug is a PhD candidate in the Center for Computer Games Research at the IT University of Copenhagen, a co-founder of the <a href="http://www.copenhagengamecollective.org/">Copenhagen Game Collective</a> and partner of his new games studio <a href="http://gutefabrik.com/">Die Gute Fabrik</a>. He's most known so far for his papers on so-called abusive and self-effacing games, realized in previous games Dark Room Sex Game, B.U.T.T.O.N., and Johann Sebastian Joust.  <br/>

- running around in the dark while monsters slowly eliminate players one by one, illuminated by flashes of light<br/>
- if you can find 3 hidden artifacts that light up, you can vanquish the monsters and win the round<br/>
<br/>
- creator of the game, doug wilson<br/>
- j.s. joust<br/>
- doctoral student/ games researcher in copenhagen, member of the copenhagen games collective<br/>
- had a chance to play joust in denmark this summer - repurposes game tech, tech we're familiar with as game players, to tap into more fundamental tropes of play<br/>
- beacons of hope does the same thing.<br/>
<br/>
- we're talking play as in mammalian play, childhood play - fun stuff, light, physical, laughter, confrontational<br/>
- bringing modern game tools into a new context - that of their roots, in a sense<br/>
<br/>
- i once ate at a 'dark' restaurant - all blind servers, completely pitch black, like 200 feet down under the earth pitch black<br/>
- worthwhile in that it was interesting to experience the sensation of being actually, completely, blinded<br/>
- we initially fumbled around with the utensils but invariably ended up eating with our hands<br/>
- we were temporarily forced to interact in the ways that felt dependent and incapable<br/>
<br/>
- in beacons of hope, players felt incapacitated in similar ways<br/>
- we fumbled on the floor, bumped into chairs and each other; i felt infantile.<br/>
- i started at the sound of footsteps, i huddled behind what seemed to be an obstacle, i hid in the corner.<br/>
- a light would flash, the sound of the monster's controllers would intensify, and i would scramble away. i would get grabbed and jump. <br/>
this was about helplessness first and foremost, and unavoidable reactions based on immediate, visceral stimuli. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- but then something amazing happened - i stumbled across one of the beacons in my blindness, and i felt a surge of adrenaline. after a moment's hesitation, i held it over my head, and pressed the button. <br/>
a clear, penetrating note from a bell resounded as my controller vibrated. i could see everything in a 15 foot radius. two other players, on their hands and knees, looked up at me startled. so did the nearest monster, who came for me immediately.<br/>

<br/>
i was eliminated, but in following games, other players were smarter than i and illuminated their beacon only for an instant, immediately moving away. i would hear one, and then two beacon melodies intertwining over the sound system. they cautiously flashed their beacons, then suddenly the third was found, they realized we had won and ran to each other, beacons flashing. we applauded. it was the most dramatic thing i've ever witnessed in a folk game like this. <br/>
<br/>
doug and his collaborators' work is a participant in an experiment of democratic technology and DIY experimentation - a claim that the technology we use should be open and accessible for us to remix and reimagine - a member of a crowd that includes kinect hacks, microcontroller boards.... reclaiming consumer technology as a cultural artifact that enables bottom-up creativity and exploration. modern folk games using the artifacts of consumer electronic games as tools is a new frontier.<br/>

Now It's Personal: On Abusive Game Design<br/>
<br/>
abusive game design reframes gameplay as a dialogic relation between player and designer – a kind of conversation that presents itself in the form of a dare.<br/>
 <br/>
the accessibility turn is narrowing the type of play that “best practice” game design aspires to create. Player narcissism leads to what we call “monologic play” – a one-sided arrangement in which systems adapt to the ideal and potential performances of players in order to satisfy them in an instrumental fashion<br/>
Players become mere customers, and designers become mere providers. In  general, this type of monologic game design is not concerned about play as an activity, but about how games as systems can facilitate a form of play that is relatively constrained to formal, predictable outcomes that can be deduced from constrained, selfcontained systems of rules [37]<br/>
<br/>
Abusive game design is designed to break the “toolness” of conventional game systems and, instead, create instruments that support a personal relation between designer and player. The game object becomes a means for a dialogue, rather than an isolated tool for play<br/>
<br/>
All that said, perhaps the clearest indicator of a successful abusive <br/>
game design is that the player feels like they are playing against a <br/>
particular person (or team of persons), and not just a system. As <br/>
long as the player takes the abuse personally, so to speak, the true <br/>
spirit of abusive game design is alive and well.<br/>
<br/>
Abusive game design confronts the conventional and <br/>
reminds us that play is, above all, something personal. <br/>

Brutally Unfair Tactics Totally OK Now: On Self-Effacing Games and Unachievements<br/>
<br/>
What distinguishes B.U.T.T.O.N., then, is that it is actively self-effacing [14]. The game does invite physical and subversive play, hinting to and even telling the players that the terms of the game are up for debate. Thus, it is not just that the rules are ambiguous; it is that the game signals an acute self-awareness of this ambiguity. The game makes it clear that players are consenting to something different than when agreeing to play a more traditional digital game. It is then up to the players to negotiate what, exactly, they have consented to.<br/>
<br/>
implementing rules need not be viewed as a “burden.” Quite the opposite, the task of interpreting, enacting, and modifying rules enables us to tailor games to the specific people we play with and to the specific contexts we play within<br/>
<br/>
The egregiously “broken” nature of the game - the fact that it does not enact but only prescribes most of its rules - opens up a highly visible space for players to bend the game to their own needs. To play the game “well” means to interpret the rules in creative ways, to gauge the appropriate intensity of physical play, and to find ways of cheating that are enjoyable for everyone playing. Sustaining a Well-Played game requires that players stay carefully attuned to the subtleties of context.</p>
