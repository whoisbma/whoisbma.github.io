<br/>
Bryan is my older brother. <br/>
<br/>
He was a primary influence on me as a gamer as well as on my game industry ambitions.<br/>
<br/>
My first memories of games include marveling at his River Raid skills, taking turns playing the original Star Wars arcade game, and jealously watching him and a friend play Fantasy Empires. In retrospect, I am not sure I was old enough to understand it in the first place.<br/>
<br/>
We would pass time during family trips with gaming trivia. For example, I would name a video game song and Bryan would respond by humming it back from memory or playing it on his guitar, in its entirety.<br/>
<br/>
His interests broadened as he focused on American history, anthropology, and ethnic studies at Wesleyan in Connecticut. Soon after graduating, he moved to China to travel, and began working with 2K Games as they set up their Shanghai studio in 2006.<br/>
<br/>
He started work as a producer on 2K Australia's XCOM, later moving into design and eventually becoming Senior Designer. He led or contributed to the creative direction and design for games published on Nintendo DS, Wii, iPhone, iPad, PC, and browser.<br/>
<br/>
He has just left 2K after over 5 years and is off for adventures unknown (?).<br/>

<br/>
Justin is my younger brother. <br/>
<br/>
His initial aspirations to the game industry, which I shared, consisted of becoming a Nintendo Power Game Counselor, working next to me. He started designing games in Flash and RPG Maker when we were in high school, as well as cultivating his considerable artistic talent.  <br/>
<br/>
For some reason I was never able to play games competitively against him. Whether that was a side effect of our brotherly bond, or prideful fear of the very likely consequence of losing to him, the world may never know.<br/>
<br/>
He had a small television in his bedroom which he connected to our PS1. I was a bit jealous, as I was off at college with nothing. <br/>
<br/>
Then he went on to study Chinese and art at Tufts in Boston. This meant I got the television, Xbox, and PS1, which was glorious. This gloriousness was quickly diminished as he soon became an early HDTV adopter.<br/>
<br/>
From 2009 to 2011, he worked as a 2K Games game designer at a desk next to mine, working on console, touchscreen, and browser games. Since leaving 2K he has been working with Matthew Davis on the IGF China-nominated <a href="http://www.ftlgame.com">FTL</a>.<br/>
