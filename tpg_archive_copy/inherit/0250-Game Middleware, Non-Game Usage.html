<h2>Game Middleware, Non-Game Usage</h2>

<p>An open-source game engine as the vehicle for an accessible, scalable, and staggeringly deep real-time biological rendering - an open Google Body-type project that uses game middleware to render the complex architecture of a mouse brain.<br/>

What does the use of a game engine have to do with it other than offering a somewhat attention-grabbing headline for us geeks?  That is, what about this would interest the average game player?  Not so much.  <br/>
<br/>
The main point is that using a game engine for this project seems to be useful for the same reasons that middleware is useful in games.  Ease of access, support, lower boundaries for entry and contribution.  <br/>
<br/>
Is this another piece in the puzzle of the saving grace of the digital entertainment business?  Something that empowers us game apologists, self-consciously searching for redeeming facets while we continue to enjoy the baser thrills of what gaming has to offer?<br/>

<blockquote>Cutting-edge experimental technologies and new microscopy methods are now able to reveal new aspects of organization within these scales, yet the development of software tools to synthesize these data into more coherent models of brain structure and function has lagged behind. The Whole Brain Catalog is a client-server platform that provides rich 3-D views for researchers to zoom in, out, and around structures deep in a multi-scale spatial framework of the mouse brain. An open-source, 3-D graphics engine used in graphics-intensive computer gaming generates high-resolution visualizations that bring data to life through biological simulations and animations.</blockquote><br/>
<br/>
Another question: what happens when game engines are more commonly purposed for non-game rendering and visualization?  Will game middleware providers find more ways to make licensing engines an attractive prospect to those working in the sciences, arts or other fields by making them as open as possible to non-game usage (and how?), or will they focus on continued specialization to suit the increasingly complex needs of big budget games?<br/>

The video is worth seeing for the production value alone!<br/>
