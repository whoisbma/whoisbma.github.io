<h2>ChinaJoy 2010; Operator as Proxy</h2>

<p>Having just visited the "E3 of China" for the fourth time - I had sworn the third was going to be my last - I was recently looking at some old photos of the very first one I attended, in 2005.<br/>
<br/>
My memories of ChinaJoy since then mainly consist of consecutive increases in volume and average number of booth girls per exhibitor... to say nothing of the performances of said booth girls.  The vast majority simply stands on or around elevated platforms amongst her contemporaries, DSLR shutters clicking inches away.  On the other hand... someone told me this year that there were pole dancers.  I did not see this.  There were belly dancers in 2008, but no poles.  My jaw has been saved from impact by the floor at least for this year.<br/>
<br/>
While enormous at roughly <a href="http://games.venturebeat.com/2010/03/31/china-online-games-market-to-hit-9-2b-in-revenues-by-2014/">3.6 billion USD in 2009</a>, the Chinese games market (read: Chinese online games market) appears to offer only a few categories of major market games, especially in terms of context, metaphor, and aesthetic.  MMOG, pseudo-historical/period, high fantasy, cute, social networking focused, and ... and that seems to about do it.  There are more things going on under the surface, but to the average western gamer looking into Chinese games, close enough.<br/>
<br/>
I noticed that back in 2005, major international publishers and first party developers were clearly staking out ChinaJoy, with Sony, Ubisoft, and many others having a significant presence.  Five years later, its hard not to be struck by their reduced numbers.<br/>
<br/>
What does the continual expansion of the local market, along with the increased reliance of international players on Chinese operators mean for the local industry and with the rest of us?  The Chinese games industry won't be just the Chinese games industry for long.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I would expect Chinese developers who aim at building an international presence will start operating on parallel level to capitalize on both markets; still stunningly different.  It's not just a question of taste, either.  <br/>
<br/>
Simply localizing a Chinese MMO for the West won't cut it - it will be much trickier than say, WoW's turbulent presence in China.  The other trouble is the business model, which has come a long way and is being caught up to by the rest of the industry even now, but I don't expect to see any significant business model innovation coming out of a Chinese game presence in the West.  The reason microtransactions were innovative was because of necessity for the local industry to monetize here on a consumer market that simply could not sustain any sort of retail possibilities.<br/>
<br/>
What do they need to do</p>
