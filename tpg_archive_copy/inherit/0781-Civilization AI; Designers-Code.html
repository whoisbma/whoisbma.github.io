So much of the design for sophisticated games is based on that fragile, tenuous balance between "good" and "fun" AI. Simulation fidelity, abstraction and context, user experience and verisimilitude all.<br/>
<br/>
The emphasis Firaxis places on the responsibility of the lead designer to also personally implement AI code among other game systems is something studios and current/prospective game designers should think long and hard about. Should a lead game designer on a AAA game be required to have lead-level gameplay programming skills?<br/>
<br/>
Whether or not that is feasible, in most cases having a dedicated "idea person" is increasingly difficult to defend. What is the value of the pure "idea person" in a studio full of idea people, all in different disciplines with different actionable skills?<br/>
<br/>
Brenda Braithwaite's compelling argument addressing the rising necessity of a strong programming foundation for any would-be game designers:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><a href="http://bbrathwaite.wordpress.com/2011/03/01/built-on-a-foundation-of-code-game-edu-rant/">Naturally, some students point to design docs or non-digital games to prove their prowess. This will no longer do – a design doc shows one thing only – that you can write a design document. There are countless ways for a game design to go wrong, and what matters is not your ability to think of an idea, but your ability to execute on that idea and bring it to life. Code is how a digital game is realized. Without it – and no matter how you represent it – you have only an idea for a game and 100 possible ways it can go wrong. The true art of game design is not in the idea, but in its implementation and the ability, dedication and determination to carry it through to the end while finding that nugget of fun. I have seen – and ignored – countless resumes with bulky design documents in favor of those who have actual running games.</a></blockquote> <br/>
<br/>
To my knowledge, Firaxis is still relatively rare in that the lead gameplay programmer and the lead game designer seems to be in many respects the same person. This is of course not to discount the work of the actual engineering leads, who have their own challenges to address - but the AI and basic game mechanics are what make each iteration of Civilization distinct as a game.<br/>
<br/>
Will more developers take on the Firaxis model, as sophisticated programming for designers becomes increasingly crucial? The age of game designers with their heads buried in design docs, occasionally emerging to code quick prototypes and doing minor scripting, is fading fast. That sounds to me like a good thing.</p>
