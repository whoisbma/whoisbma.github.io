- new game to playtest in NYC<br/>
- beacons of hope<br/>
- running around in the dark while monsters slowly eliminate players one by one, illuminated by flashes of light<br/>
- if you can find 3 hidden artifacts that light up, you can vanquish the monsters and win the round<br/>
<br/>
- creator of the game, doug wilson<br/>
- j.s. joust<br/>
- doctoral student/ games researcher in copenhagen, member of the copenhagen games collective<br/>
- had a chance to play joust in denmark this summer - repurposes game tech, tech we're familiar with as game players, to tap into more fundamental tropes of play<br/>
- beacons of hope does the same thing.<br/>
<br/>
- we're talking play as in mammalian play, childhood play - fun stuff, light, physical, laughter, confrontational<br/>
- bringing modern game tools into a new context - that of their roots, in a sense<br/>
<br/>
- i once ate at a 'dark' restaurant - all blind servers, completely pitch black, like 200 feet down under the earth pitch black<br/>
- worthwhile in that it was interesting to experience the sensation of being actually, completely, blinded<br/>
- we initially fumbled around with the utensils but invariably ended up eating with our hands<br/>
- we were temporarily forced to interact in the ways that felt dependent and incapable<br/>
<br/>
- in beacons of hope, players felt incapacitated in similar ways<br/>
- we fumbled on the floor, bumped into chairs and each other; i felt infantile.<br/>
- i started at the sound of footsteps, i huddled behind what seemed to be an obstacle, i hid in the corner.<br/>
- a light would flash, the sound of the monster's controllers would intensify, and i would scramble away. i would get grabbed and jump. <br/>
this was about helplessness first and foremost, and unavoidable reactions based on immediate, visceral stimuli. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- but then something amazing happened - i stumbled across one of the beacons in my blindness, and i felt a surge of adrenaline. after a moment's hesitation, i held it over my head, and pressed the button. <br/>
a clear, penetrating note from a bell resounded as my controller vibrated. i could see everything in a 15 foot radius. two other players, on their hands and knees, looked up at me startled. so did the nearest monster, who came for me immediately.<br/>

<br/>
i was eliminated, but in following games, other players were smarter than i and illuminated their beacon only for an instant, immediately moving away. i would hear one, and then two beacon melodies intertwining over the sound system. they cautiously flashed their beacons, then suddenly the third was found, they realized we had won and ran to each other, beacons flashing. we applauded. it was the most dramatic thing i've ever witnessed in a folk game like this. <br/>
<br/>
doug and his collaborators' work is a participant in an experiment of democratic technology and DIY experimentation - a claim that the technology we use should be open and accessible for us to remix and reimagine - a member of a crowd that includes kinect hacks, microcontroller boards.... reclaiming consumer technology as a cultural artifact that enables bottom-up creativity and exploration. modern folk games using the artifacts of consumer electronic games as tools is a new frontier.<br/>

abusive game design reframes gameplay as a dialogic relation between player and designer – a kind of conversation that presents itself in the form of a dare.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
the accessibility turn is narrowing the type of play that “best practice” game design aspires to create. Player narcissism leads to what we call “monologic play” – a one-sided arrangement in which systems adapt to the ideal and potential performances of players in order to satisfy them in an instrumental fashion<br/>
Players become mere customers, and designers become mere providers. In  general, this type of monologic game design is not concerned about play as an activity, but about how games as systems can facilitate a form of play that is relatively constrained to formal, predictable outcomes that can be deduced from constrained, selfcontained systems of rules [37]<br/>
<br/>
Abusive game design is designed to break the “toolness” of conventional game systems and, instead, create instruments that support a personal relation between designer and player. The game object becomes a means for a dialogue, rather than an isolated tool for play</p>
