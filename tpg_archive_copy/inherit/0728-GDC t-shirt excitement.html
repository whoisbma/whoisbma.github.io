Guys, you're <strong>really</strong> not selling me on this shirt!<br/>
<br/>
I see two main possibilities here. <br/>
<br/>
1: The folks in charge of getting us excited about a free GDC t-shirt couldn't be bothered to get the shirt model similarly excited.<br/>
<br/>
2: The folks in charge of getting us excited about a free GDC t-shirt are using the shirt ad as a subtle commentary on the nature of conference-goer aesthetics, swag, or the nature of advertising in general.<br/>
<br/>
Please advise.</p>
