Contagium was made for the Global Game Jam 2011 in Shanghai by the brothers Ma using <a href="http://www.yoyogames.com/gamemaker">Game Maker</a> by YoYo Games.  Play as a lone white blood cell, and try to stave off infection!<br/>

In early 2011 we were thinking it would be funny to throw together something that I had designed and drawn out as a seven year old - a shmup based on the immune system, which was inspired by a children's book we had when much younger - <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=EJggmvhMVAEC&printsec=frontcover&dq=macrophage+lymphocyte+%22cell+wars%22&source=bl&ots=oW9DgaCNBZ&sig=E6qSDYsxAJO8FwM8HccrcV-ep-s&hl=zh-CN&ei=0kVjTca5IpK-sAOBo4jWCA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false">Cell Wars</a>! <br/>
<br/>
It explained the processes of foreign bacteria and viruses in the human body as well as the responses of white blood cells and other elements. Obviously the biological explanations were simplified quite a bit but nevertheless got me thinking about the drama of these microscopic battles. I loved the idea so much I put together a folder of game, character, and level design illustrations and explanations based on it.<br/>
<br/>
The theme for GGJ 2011 turned out to be "Extinction" - and so our minds instantly were brought back to the white blood cell shooter concept.  We settled on quick, round-based, arena shooter gameplay.  We jammed through the weekend, got it up on the GGJ site (<a href="http://www.thepretentiousgamer.com/page/contagium-global-game-jam-2011-shanghai/">barely</a>), and decided we liked it so much, we would continue to polish it.<br/>
