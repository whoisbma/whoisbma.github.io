<h2>Linguistic Nuance, Imagination</h2>

<p>With a language based on characters rather than a phonetic alphabet, you can generally communicate much more information in much less space. For example, Chinese tweets can carry much more complexity, and nuance than we can in English.<br/>
<br/>
Though there's something to be said for the original English translation remaining in all-caps compared to the more comfortably legible lower-case of the new translation/interpretation, its undoubtedly more subtle and human, with less imperatives and more suggestion. Compare "YOU KNOW ALL I CAN TEACH YOU. GO." with "I donâ€™t have anything more to tell you. Go, and take care of yourself."<br/>
<br/>
Still, "IT'S DANGEROUS TO GO ALONE" retains its own undeniably poetic, yet robotic quality. <br/>
<br/>
For some reason, just like the lo-fi art and sound, it seems there are certain spaces left by poorly translated text (by necessity or otherwise) of that era that allowed our adolescent imaginations the room to more easily fill the gaps. <br/>
<br/>
These spaces made playing these games an imaginative exercise - an experience of assisted make-believe - rather than being something that explicitly communicated a vision of another reality.<br/>
