<p>This week Shanghai held its 16th <a href="http://www.pecha-kucha.org/night/shanghai/16">Pecha Kucha</a> at the <a href="http://www.dutchdesignworkspace.com/">Dutch Design Workspace</a>, and The Pretentious Gamer came by to talk about how games and "gameness" are transcending each other.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote>PechaKucha Night was devised in Tokyo in February 2003 as an event for young designers to meet, network, and show their work in public. It has turned into a massive celebration, with events happening in hundreds of cities around the world, inspiring creatives worldwide. Drawing its name from the Japanese term for the sound of "chit chat", it rests on a presentation format that is based on a simple idea: 20 images x 20 seconds. It's a format that makes presentations concise, and keeps things moving at a rapid pace.</blockquote><br/>
<br/>
Being a mixed-discipline design-focused event, Pecha Kucha is a great opportunity to get non-game folks engaged with some of the ideas that are coming out of games and game culture, promote literacy of the medium, and hopefully get people to start playing as well. <br/>
<br/>
20 slides at 20 seconds per slide and a lot of context to cover meant for a very fast, perhaps incoherent presentation. But here it is anyway.<br/>
