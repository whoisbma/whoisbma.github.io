The theme was "extinction", and we tried to tie that into a simple arena shooter about the immune system.<br/>

We originally thought we only had about one day to work, as Justin was flying on Saturday and I on Sunday.  <br/>

As it turned out, we managed to get almost all of Saturday to work on it, which let us get a good deal further than we thought we were going to be able to do.<br/>
<br/>
On Sunday, during a stopover for my flight, I misjudged the amount of time it would take me to debug a bit more and upload to the GGJ site.  As it turned out, Justin managed to get it online last minute after a frantic hour or two search for internet. <br/>
<br/>
We weren't around to see the final presentations on Sunday but we had a great time hanging out with everybody, including <a href="http://www.klikscene.com">Glen</a>, <a href="http://fobtastic.posterous.com/">Chris</a>, <a href="http://levelwan.com/">Rachel</a>, and all the guys at <a href="http://coconutislandstudio.com/">Coconut Island</a> in Shanghai.  </p>
