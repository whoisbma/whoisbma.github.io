<p>I found this amusing - using a gaming icon to illustrate trends covering a few different topics.<br/>

Commenter response to the video on Kotaku seems to communicate disdain, ambivalence, or utter bafflement.  The struggle seems to be with either the lack of a powerful message or the strangeness of familiar game elements used out of context.  It is what it is ... only using a somewhat unorthodox medium for the subject matter.<br/>
<br/>
Certainly by this point, Mario and other gaming icons have adequately penetrated the cultural/societal lexicon to be used effectively to communicate an out of context message.  Will framing real life issues within the vocabulary of interactive entertainment become more widespread with technological accessibility and increased (possibly) cultural relevance?  This also has plenty of implications for the serious games movement.<br/>
