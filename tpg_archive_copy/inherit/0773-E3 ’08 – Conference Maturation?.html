The change E3 has undergone in the past few years is interesting, albeit staggering. The last time I attended an E3 was still during its youthful, insane, experimental age that all growing conventions go through after puberty. Now that it has settled into relative maturity, many people seem to lament its transformation. I for one, do not.<br/>
<br/>
Previously, the E3 experience could only be categorized as overstimulating. Hoards of people blanket the main exhibition hall from morning to night. Since it was open to the public at that time, the crowd is primarily composed of videogamers and fans and their excitement is almost palpable. Every aspect of E3 seemed to be designed with this demographic in mind. The booths are hyper-sensationalistic and each company does everything in their power (and budget) to grab the short attention span of the convention-goers. Many took this to the extreme by abandoning any connection between their booth and their product, favoring instead bright lights, unusual layouts, and the ever-popular sexual appeal of booth-babes.<br/>
<br/>
I can't help but attempt to avoid unnecessary long lines and social claustrophobia. Therefore I spent the majority of this previous E3 walking the floor, observing the videogames and chaos from a relative distance.  The one exception to my aversion to waiting in line to try was Shadow of the Colossus which was well worth the wait.<br/>

E3 '08, however was of a much different atmosphere. The "booths" were merely large screens attached in an uniform manner to pillars throughout the hall. The only discerning feature between the booths were the logos printed on signs, all forms of embellishment were abandoned. The majority of studios had the same size space to show their games, however the displays ranged from 2 to 8 screens depending on how many games they had available.<br/>
<br/>
This new arrangement lead to a completely different ambiance and presentation style for the show. This year the <em>games themselves</em> were once again the focus of the show, rather than the image surrounding the game. The restriction on the public's access to E3 also had a huge impact on how developers approached this show. Because their main goal was to present and discuss their game with attendees (rather than to grab the attention of as many people as possible), people who had a large role in the development of the game seem to have been much more willing personally represent their product.<br/>
This resulted in a calm atmosphere where I could approach many booths and have an in depth conversation about the games development, any issues they've had in the creation process, the studio's future intentions and ideas, and so on, all while demoing the game.<br/>
