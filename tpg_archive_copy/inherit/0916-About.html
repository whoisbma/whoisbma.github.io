<h2><font size="+3">The Pretentious Gamer is ...</font></h2><br/>
<br/>
... authored by two brothers and game developers who haven't earned the right to think we're so great. But we still think we're pretty great anyway.<br/>
<br/>
... a reflection on the ironies and basic silliness of gaming snob culture. We subscribe to it nonetheless.<br/>
<br/>
... not intended to be taken too seriously (we are talking about games after all).<br/>
<br/>
... full of opinions that are solely our own and not those of our employers. Thank you for employing us, employers.<br/>
<br/>
... about celebrating what's great about games, making them, where they are going, and what they can do.<br/>
