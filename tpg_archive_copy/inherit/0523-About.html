<h2><font size="+3">The Pretentious Gamer is ...</font></h2><br/>
<br/>
... authored by two brothers and upstart game developers who haven't earned the right to think we're so great.  But we still think we're pretty great anyway.<br/>
<br/>
... titled to be a reflection on the ironies and basic silliness of gaming snob culture, while subscribing to it nonetheless.<br/>
<br/>
... not intended to be taken too seriously (we are talking about games after all).<br/>
<br/>
... full of opinions that are solely our own and not those of our employers.  Thank you for employing us, employers.<br/>
<br/>
... about celebrating what's great about games, where they are going, what they can do, and making them.<br/>
