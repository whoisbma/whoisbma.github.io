<blockquote>"I believe there [are] still lessons to be learned by studying and playing the classics. I believe that it's fundamentally important to have a strong grounding in the history in which one designs and writes; the twisted thing is though, I can't explain why it's important. Often, their mechanics are somewhat broken, their graphics pitifully archaic by modern standards, and their difficulty punishing; by comparison, modern games are a marvel of design, similar to comparing the Kitty Hawk to an A380. And yet surely, if it's been done before, isn't it important to know about it and understand how it was done?"</blockquote><br/>
