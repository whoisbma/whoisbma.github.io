<h2>ChinaJoy 2010; Operator as Proxy</h2>

<p>Having just visited the "E3 of China" for the fourth time - I had sworn the third was going to be my last - I was recently looking at some old photos of the very first one I attended, in 2005.<br/>
<br/>
My memories of ChinaJoy since then mainly consist of consecutive increases in volume and average number of booth girls per exhibitor... to say nothing of the performances of said booth girls.  The vast majority simply stands on or around elevated platforms amongst her contemporaries, DSLR shutters clicking inches away.  On the other hand... someone told me this year that there were pole dancers.  I did not see this.  Belly dancers in 2008, but no poles.  <br/>
<br/>
While enormous at roughly <a href="http://games.venturebeat.com/2010/03/31/china-online-games-market-to-hit-9-2b-in-revenues-by-2014/">3.6 billion USD in 2009</a>, the Chinese games market (read: Chinese online games market) appears to offer only a few categories of major market games, especially in terms of context, metaphor, and aesthetic.  MMOG, pseudo-historical/period, high fantasy, cute, social networking focused, and ... and that seems to about do it.  There are more things going on under the surface, but to the average western gamer looking into Chinese games, ??? as they say.  Close enough.<br/>
<br/>
I noticed that back in 2005, major international publishers and first party developers were clearly staking out ChinaJoy, with Sony, Ubisoft, and many others having a significant presence.  Five years later, its hard not to be struck by their utter absence, at least as far as I could see.<br/>
<br/>
Absolutely, certain foreign-developed products had their place</p>
