<p><em>"Brian Eno has suggested that pop music is interesting due to the wide range of people and expressions it can contain, covering a spectrum from conceptually oriented musicians to people who are merely in it for style. ... That game aficionados can scoff at the tastes of the general public is merely an indication that games are becoming like pop music. ... The rift ... is a sign of the maturity of the medium."<br/>

<h2>The Pretentious Gamer is ...</h2><br/>
... authored by two brothers and game designers.<br/>
... about taking games seriously, while recognizing the inherent ironies and silliness in doing so.<br/>
... full of opinions that are solely our own and not those of our employers, or anyone else.<br/>
... meant to celebrate what's great about games, making them, and what they can be.<br/>
