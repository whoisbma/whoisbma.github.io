<p>A local indie / iPhone developer, <a href="http://www.coconutislandstudio.com/">Coconut Island Studios</a>, is hosting a <a href="http://www.globalgamejam.org/">Global Game Jam</a> event for the very first time in Shanghai:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote>The 2011 Global Game Jam has its first home in Shanghai at Coconut Island Studio. The team has had experience running previous game jams and enthusiastically opens their doors to anyone who wishes to participate in getting together, having fun, designing/ drawing/ coding/ playing games, and making awesome.</blockquote><br/>
<br/>
We will be there to see what sort of weird stuff we can come up with.<br/>
<br/>
Game Jams are intended to promote and foster experimentation with and the creation of innovative, unusual, and otherwise interesting micro-games within an arbitrary timeline.  In this case it is 48 hours - a relatively lenient deadline - plenty of time!  <br/>
<br/>
Famous last words.<br/>
<br/>
Don't have programming skills?  Design a board or card game, or join with a team that needs your particular talents.<br/>
<br/>
Hope to see many of our Shanghai game development contemporaries there!<br/>
