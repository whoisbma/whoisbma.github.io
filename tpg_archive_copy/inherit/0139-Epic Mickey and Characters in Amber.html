<p>I still am in disbelief that they are letting Warren Spector do this.<br/>

A recent <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/05/business/media/05mickey.html">NYTimes article</a> addresses <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_Mickey">Epic Mickey</a> and what it means for Disney's characters.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote>Keeping cartoon characters trapped in amber is one of the surest routes to irrelevancy. While Mickey remains a superstar in many homes, particularly overseas, his static nature has resulted in a generation of Americans ‚Äî the one that grew up with Nickelodeon and Pixar ‚Äî that knows him, but may not love him. Domestic sales in particular have declined: of his $5 billion in merchandise sales in 2009, less than 20 percent will come from the United States.<br/>
<br/>
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a distinct risk of alienating your core consumer when you tweak a sacred character, but at this point it‚Äôs a risk they have to take,‚Äù said Matt Britton, the managing partner of Mr. Youth, a New York brand consultant firm.</blockquote><br/>
<br/>
Nintendo, Miyamoto, take note!  Capcom, take note!  <strong>"Keeping ... characters trapped in amber is one of the surest routes to irrelevancy."</strong>  Mario and Link are not sacred!  Megaman is not sacred!  Give us something new, something relevant!  These characters and franchises are sorely in need of some new ideas.<br/>
<br/>
They're still fun, but they're safe, guarded.  They aren't moving games forward.  <br/>
<br/>
Right now Nintendo is caught between taking advantage of nostalgia (New Super Mario Bros. Wii) and presumably finding the best direction for the next big Mario and Zelda productions.  If I were them, I would be pushing for a major reimagination.</p>
