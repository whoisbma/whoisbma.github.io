<p>I've taken some time off to return to the US from Shanghai and focus on some side projects.<br/>
<br/>
Working on TPG and crunching in a studio full time made me realize that working on games, writing about games, and playing games happens to take up a giant chunk of time that I needed for other, non-game things. (gasp!)<br/>
<br/>
Now that I'm not focused on schedules, budgets, and design docs, I now have the time to start posting regularly.<br/>
<br/>
So! There are games to write about.</p>
