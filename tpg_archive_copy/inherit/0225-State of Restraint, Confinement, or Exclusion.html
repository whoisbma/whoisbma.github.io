<p><a href="http://playdeadgames.com/">Playdead's Limbo </a>was a fantastic experience, and I use the term very pointedly.  <br/>
<br/>
It emphasized a play expression deeply tied to its aesthetic values, rather than game mechanics.  The challenges were purely based off of a finely tuned physical simulation (and very minor scripted AI) with little bits of intriguing details thrown in.  It wasn't particularly memorable as a "game" per se, but regardless was notable for its nearly Portal or Braid-like cerebral challenges without incorporating necessarily mind-bending mechanics.<br/>
<br/>
As a game as well as an experience, an easy connection to make would be to Chahi's early games - the quiet, the menace, the danger, the inevitability - as well as the replays, the replays, the replays.  The replays.<br/>
<br/>
However the aesthetics - the sound, the visuals, the simplicity, the feelings evoked - were just fantastic.  Especially the sound.  I demoed the game to teams at the office, and our sound designers immediately said - wait.  "We need to plug monitors into this, now" and proceeded to gape at the atmospheric sound design. <br/>
<br/>
Most complaints I've seen directed at the game appear to be focused on its relatively short length.  Perhaps its just my increasing unwillingness to get sucked into 50 hour plus games talking, but I think this is not much of a criticism. <br/>
<br/>
Where I would criticize however is that the arc of the game's level design led to an ultimately weak conclusion - or weaker than it could have been, I would wager.<br/>
<br/>
 a weak conclusion - the human element of the danger was by far the most memorable.  your peers trying to murder you.  followed by the natural world - the spider was terrifying.  finally the mechanical, the man-made - this was least affecting.  but it was solely the man-made that dominated the third act.<br/>
there is something much more deeply disturbing in the lord of the flies-like cruelty and society hinted at in the forts and constructions of the other children - a place where you were distinctly "the other". <br/>
the systematic, the predictable, the inevitable behavior of the mechanisms of the third act made the most sense for ramping up the gameplay challenges - but they remain very inhuman.  a combination of the human and the mechanical, in some way, may have made for a more compelling conclusion.<br/>

<br/>
"such infants as quit the body without being baptized will be involved in the mildest condemnation of all. That person, therefore, greatly deceives both himself and others, who teaches that they will not be involved in condemnation; whereas the apostle says: 'Judgment from one offence to condemnation' (Romans 5:16), and again a little after: 'By the offence of one upon all persons to condemnation' (Romans 5:18)."<br/>
<br/>
"If heaven is a state of supernatural happiness and union with God, and hell is understood as a state of torture and separation from God then, in this view, the Limbo of Infants, although technically part of hell (the outermost part, "limbo" meaning "outer edge" or "hem")"<br/>
<br/>
Limbo plays on our infantile fear of each other, our fear of the natural world, and of the world we create.  It personifies the fear and the abstract menace of dark (and even not so dark) fairy tales.<br/>
<br/>
their focus on cannabalism, on mechanical implements, on decapitation, suicide.<br/>

"The Lost Childen<br/>
What It’s Like: Hansel & Gretel meets Saw 2<br/>
This French fairy tale starts out just like Hansel & Gretel. A brother and sister get lost in the woods and find themselves trapped in cages, getting plumped up to be eaten. Only it’s not a wicked witch, it’s the Devil and his wife. The Devil makes a sawhorse for the little boy to bleed to death on (seriously!) and then goes for a walk, telling the girl to get her brother situated on the sawhorse before he returned. The siblings pretend to be confused and ask the Devil’s wife to demonstrate how the boy should lay on the sawhorse; when she shows them they tie her to it and slit her throat. They steal all of the Devil’s money and escape in his carriage. He chases after them once he discovers what they’ve done, but he dies in the process. Yikes."<br/>
<br/>
3. The Juniper Tree<br/>
What It’s Like: Every stepchild’s worst nightmare<br/>
Cannibalism, murder, decapitation? freakiness abounds left and right in this weird Grimm story. A widower gets remarried, but the second wife loathes the son he had with his first wife because she wants her daughter to inherit the family riches. So she offers the little boy an apple from inside a chest. When he leans over to get it, she slams the lid down on him and chops his head off. Note: if you’re trying to convince your child to eat more fruits and veggies, do not tell them this story. Well, the woman doesn’t want anyone to know that she killed the boy, so she puts his head back on and wraps a handkerchief around his neck to hide the fact that it’s no longer attached. Her daughter ends up knocking his head off and getting blamed for his death. To hide what happened, they chop up the body and make him into pudding, which they feed to his poor father. Eventually the boy is reincarnated as a bird and he drops a stone on his stepmother’s head, which kills her and brings him back to life.<br/>
<br/>
In the tale of the Pied Piper, we have a village overrun with rats. A man arrives dressed in clothes of pied (a patchwork of colors) and offers to rid the town of the vermin. The villagers agree to pay a vast sum of money if the piper can do it – and he does. He plays music on his pipe which draws all the rats out of the town. When he returns for payment – the villagers won’t cough up so the Pied Piper decides to rid the town of children too! In most modern variants, the piper draws the children to a cave out of the town and when the townsfolk finally agree to pay up, he sends them back. In the darker original, the piper leads the children to a river where they all drown (except a lame boy who couldn’t keep up). Some modern scholars say that there are connotations of pedophilia in this fairy tale.<br/>
<br/>
In the widely known version of Hansel and Gretel, we hear of two little children who become lost in the forest, eventually finding their way to a gingerbread house which belongs to a wicked witch. The children end up enslaved for a time as the witch prepares them for eating. They figure their way out and throw the witch in a fire and escape. In an earlier French version of this tale (called The Lost Children), instead of a witch we have a devil. Now the wicked old devil is tricked by the children (in much the same way as Hansel and Gretel) but he works it out and puts together a sawhorse to put one of the children on to bleed (that isn’t an error – he really does). The children pretend not to know how to get on the sawhorse so the devil’s wife demonstrates. While she is lying down the kids slash her throat and escape.<br/>
<br/>
Design Notes:<br/>
<br/>
Sound can do so much more than most players realize, until its either as good as this<br/>
Don't underestimate the human element for drama.  <br/>
The suggestion of danger can be just as powerful and driving as staring it in the face.</p>
