<p>We had a chance to mess around with the Winnitron at GDC this year, and we knew we had to make one.<br/>
<br/>
Almost finished!<br/>

R3 can hardly contain himself. This is normal.<br/>

The control panel still needs a bit of work and will have a metal casing. Lightbox coming soon, and electronics are more or less good to go and just waiting for the panel.<br/>
<br/>
The design was largely based on the work of the guys putting together the <a href="http://blog.redpointsoftware.com.au/category/winnitron-au/">Winnitron AU</a>... Thanks again to them and to all the <a href="http://bitcollective.ca/">BitCollective</a> folks.<br/>
