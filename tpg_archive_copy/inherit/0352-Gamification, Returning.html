<h2>Gamification, Returning</h2>

<p>First we game:  <br/>
<br/>
We use technology to explore imagined rules, stories, physics, characters, and worlds.  We use mechanics to set logic and induce pleasure through the learning and later exploitation of these rules.  We assign scores, winners, and losers; we compete.  We play.<br/>
<br/>
Then we gamify life:  <br/>
<br/>
We use the vocabulary of gaming and the systems of game mechanics to change how we experience the world.  We "check in" everywhere we go to get Achievements.  We become the Mayor, and get bonus points.  We assign point values to housework, using the reward structures of role playing games and competition with our housemates to influence how we maintain our living spaces. We level up after cleaning house.<br/>
<br/>
What next?  Gamification returns to games:  <br/>
<br/>
On <a href="http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showthread.php?t=418298">NeoGAF</a>, addressing a rumored feature of the Nintendo 3DS - <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote>The internal podometer of the console gets how many steps you've walked and will reward you with Game Coins that can be used to unlock extra content.<br/>
<br/>
This content will be unlocked in the different retail games, and coins are not tied to an specific game, nor the AR games or the embedded software. All games can use this feature.<br/>
<br/>
It's expected the Street Pass feature will be emphasized through this.</blockquote><br/>

We use gameplay mechanics to change how we behave in the real world - but then we bring it back to the game itself?<br/>
<br/>
This is clever on a number of different levels for Nintendo - they find a new way to encourage you to carry (and play) your 3DS all the time, they look like the good guys by encouraging exercise(?) for our legions of screen-addicted couch potatoes, and they potentially open up new possibilities for interfacing real-life activity with the games we play.  Collaborations and tie-ins could be all over the place - but I doubt they'll want to branch out too much.</p>
