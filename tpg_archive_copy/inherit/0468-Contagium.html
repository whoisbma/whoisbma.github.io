Contagium was made for the Global Game Jam 2011 in Shanghai by the brothers Ma using <a href="http://www.yoyogames.com/gamemaker">Game Maker</a> by YoYo Games.  Play as a lone white blood cell, and trying to stave off infection!<br/>
<br/>
In early 2011 we were thinking it would be funny to throw together something that I had designed and drawn out as a kid - a shmup based on the immune system, which was inspired by a children's book we had when much younger - Cell Wars! <br/>
<br/>
It explained the processes of foreign bacteria and viruses in the human body as well as the responses of white blood cells and other elements. Obviously it was simplified quite a bit but nevertheless got me thinking about the drama of these invisible processes.<br/>
<br/>
The theme for GGJ 2011 turned out to be "Extinction" - and so our minds instantly were brought back to the white blood cell shooter concept.  We jammed through the weekend and got it up on the GGJ site, and decided we liked it so much, we would continue to polish it up.<br/>
<br/>
