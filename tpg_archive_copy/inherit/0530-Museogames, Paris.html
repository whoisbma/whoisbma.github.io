<p>While in Paris, we managed to check out the <a href="http://museogames.com/">Museogames exhibition</a> at the incredible <a href="http://www.arts-et-metiers.net/">Musée des Arts et Métiers</a> (Museum of Arts and Crafts).<br/>

<br/>
The collection was a testament to careful preservation of the artifacts of the medium, and a statement on their cultural, artistic, and technical historical value - they "bear witness to the technical developments of their time; they have played an important role in our economic, social and cultural history and represent an essential link between the inventions that preceded them and those that were to come after them."  <br/>
<br/>
The exhibition is finally closing on the 13th of March, so hopefully the photos can give a sense of what it was like to be there.  <br/>

The show featured two collections brought together - an extensive, once private collection (over 1500 pieces) which was acquired by the museum, and that of <a href="http://mo5.com/">MO5.com</a>, an organization dedicated to "the preservation and public dissemination of digital heritage."<br/>
