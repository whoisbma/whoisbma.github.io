<p>My boss often jokes that if a game was made after 1995, I'm not interested.  Not exactly true, but...<br/>

A nice <a href="http://redkingsdream.com/2010/02/learning-from-history/#">article </a>from Evan Stubbs pointing out just how derivative most of what we are playing now essentially is.<br/>

<blockquote>"I believe there‚Äôs still lessons to be learned by studying and playing the classics. I believe that it‚Äôs fundamentally important to have a strong grounding in the history in which one designs and writes; the twisted thing is though, I can‚Äôt explain why it‚Äôs important. Often, their mechanics are somewhat broken, their graphics pitifully archaic by modern standards, and their difficulty punishing; by comparison, modern games are a marvel of design, similar to comparing the Kitty Hawk to an A380. And yet surely, if it‚Äôs been done before, isn‚Äôt it important to know about it and understand how it was done?"</blockquote><br/>
