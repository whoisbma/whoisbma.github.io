<br/>
In early 2011 we were thinking it would be amusing to realize a design I had created as a child - a shmup based on the immune system. It was inspired by a children's book we had as kids; <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=EJggmvhMVAEC&printsec=frontcover&dq=macrophage+lymphocyte+%22cell+wars%22&source=bl&ots=oW9DgaCNBZ&sig=E6qSDYsxAJO8FwM8HccrcV-ep-s&hl=zh-CN&ei=0kVjTca5IpK-sAOBo4jWCA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false">Cell Wars</a>, by Fran Balkwill.<br/>
<br/>
It explained the basic biological processes of foreign bacteria and viruses and the subsequent responses of white blood cells and other elements of the immune system in the human body. I was so struck by the drama of these microscopic battles that I put together a folder of game, character, and level design illustrations and explanations based on the book.<br/>
<br/>
Back in 2011, the theme for the game jam turned out to be "Extinction" - and despite only a casual connection, we thought of the white blood cell shooter concept. We settled on minimal round-based arena shooter gameplay, jammed through the weekend, got it up on the GGJ site (<a href="http://www.thepretentiousgamer.com/page/contagium-global-game-jam-2011-shanghai/">barely</a>), and decided we liked it enough to continue to polish it.<br/>
<br/>
Use the WASD keys, the mouse or arrow keys, and the spacebar to play. Neutralize viruses with antibodies, then absorb them. Try to prevent infection while keeping yourself alive.<br/>
