<strong><font size="+3">The Pretentious Gamer</strong> is ...</font><br/>
<br/>
... authored by two brothers and upstart game developers who haven't earned the right to think we're so great.  But we think we're pretty great anyway.<br/>
<br/>
... about reconciling self-righteous snootiness with overwhelming, debilitating geekiness.<br/>
<br/>
... not intended to be taken too seriously (we are talking about games after all).<br/>
<br/>
... about fighting against our our deeply ingrained games-apologist tendencies and viewing the industry critically.<br/>
<br/>
... about finding and examining our place as young, cog-in-the-machine game developers as the medium and our careers advance (here's hoping).<br/>
<br/>
... full of opinions that are solely our own and not those of our <a href="http://www.2kgames.com/">employers</a>.  Thank you for employing us, employers.<br/>
<br/>
... about celebrating what's great about what games, and making them.<br/>
