  - The imagery of <a href="http://www.quelsolaar.com/love/index.html">Love </a> made me recall discussions I periodically have with my girlfriend, who is a fine artist by training.  I show her various videogames that I considered to have new and unique art styles.  She responds that it looks almost the same as every other 3D game, even ones i would consider to be very different.  These conversations lead to the realization that "large differences" in art direction of most 3D games in reality are only slight differences when considering the <em>overall effect</em> received by the viewer.  While the differences in atmosphere, color tone, detail of textures & shapes, and light's interaction with the environment may be significant between games like Shadow of the Colossus, Half Life 2, Gears of War 2 & Okami, the similarities outweigh the differences.  They all consist of objects of certain colors and shapes placed within a 3D environment where light sources determine color intensity & darkening viewed from a mobile camera: essentially, the modern definition of rendering a 3d environment. <br/>
<br/>
  - Her primary question is:  With technology at the state it is, why isn't exploration of other methods of visually representing space more common?  Can we visually create the atmosphere of walking down a city street without attempting to recreate each individual lamppost or garbage can?  Can we rethink digital 3d space in a manner distinct from the legacy of games like Wolfenstein?<br/>
<br/>
  - As far as I can figure, there are 2 general methods of at least partially achieving this goal.<br/>
  - The first is to create a 3D space in the traditional sense, but then apply complex filters to change the viewer's perception of the world.<br/>
  - The second is to rethink from the ground up how to make the viewer perceive movement through an environment while viewing a 2D screen.<br/>
<br/>
<strong><br/>
<em>"Post Processing":</em></strong><br/>
<br/>
  - I believe that the art style shown in the gameplay video of Love is a simple example of the first method.  Love's engine applies subtle distortion effects onto very basic geometric shapes with simple textures of solid or gradient colors.  The effect in motion is that object's exact position in space seems to very subtly change depending where you view it & the borders between objects are difficult to discern.  Normally one may consider these to be signs of an ineffective representation of 3d space, however in practice it is not only successful but in some ways it makes the environment feel more vivid and alive without requiring much complexity or detail.<br/>
<br/>
  - Love is only applying this post processing effect very minimally, but it begs the viewer to question what the limits of such a method are. Rather than mapping a static high-res texture on the surface of objects what would it look like to have the program dynamically represent surfaces differently based on where you view it?  Instead of light sources ray tracing to objects to determine which areas are in shadow, how about having the 3d objects themselves be represented differently depending on where light sources are in a scene: with distorted edges and shapes?  I  describe these concepts somewhat abstractly because I am not sure how one could program these effects, nor do I understand exactly what the final effect would be.  I merely feel that there is still considerable opportunity to push the boundaries on these concepts.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<strong><br/>
<em>"Reinvention":</em></strong><br/>
<br/>
  - I can give even less concrete descriptions about what I picture the second method to be.  I consider discussions like these to be an exercise in thought, as well as a reality check to the limitations of the normal representation of 3D space.<br/>
<br/>
- First consider this piece of concept art for Mass Effect 2:<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
  - 3D artists would see the environment depicted in the picture and try and recreate the atmosphere of the scene by rebuilding it piece by piece.  For example, the plantlife covered rocks in the foreground would be modeled & textured so that every leaf & rock could be individually observed (perhaps even with normal maps to add more depth).  This underlines the mentality 3D designers have in recreating 3D environments: "In this world there are many objects that, when directly observed, have great detail. Therefore, to create a realistic digital environment we need to populate the digital world with just as many detailed objects.  This allows the viewer to believe the space is more real."<br/>
<br/>
  - However this is not the only way to represent the world.  What kind of interactive software could we come up with if we attempted to recreate how we view the world rather than strictly recreating the elements of the world in perfect detail?  As we walk down a street we (through practice) can understand that there are rust covered fences lining the sidewalk without having to stare at the complicated patterns of rust & peeling paint.  We can create a picture of the layout and general atmosphere of a scene in our mind without having to directly observe each individual element.  That is why many people feel that impressionistic paintings or concept art can be more engaging than photo-realistic paintings.  Simply through the use of atmosphere and tone these images can instill an even greater understanding of what being in these environments would feel like.  The viewer's mind is left with the task of filling in the specific details of the landscape, for example: finding patterns of leaves in random shapes of color on the "plantlife covered rocks".<br/>
<br/>
  - Programming a system to dynamically create the impression of an environment without having to explicitly shape each individual element is no small task, but perhaps that's why I find the concept so exciting.  There's many different directions this idea could be taken, for example: creating images akin to concept art dynamically as you move through the environment (with fluid brush strokes representing more complicated objects, etc); or somehow implying there are objects in a space through colors rather than polygon models, with the more influential objects resolving into more detail.  <br/>
<br/>
  - I do not know how one would go about implementing these ideas, but I think with experimentation one could stumble upon very new and unique visual styles for interactive media and games and in doing so reinvent what we consider to be a "3D" world. </p>
