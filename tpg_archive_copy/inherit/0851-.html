</h2><br/>
<br/>
Bryan is my older brother. <br/>
<br/>
He was a primary influence on me as a gamer as well as on my game industry ambitions.<br/>
<br/>
My first memories of games include marveling at his River Raid skills, taking turns playing the original Star Wars arcade game, and jealously watching him and a friend play Fantasy Empires. In retrospect, I am not sure I was old enough to understand it in the first place.<br/>
<br/>
We would pass time during family trips with gaming trivia. For example, I would name a video game song and Bryan would respond by humming it back from memory or playing it on his guitar, in its entirety.<br/>
<br/>
His interests broadened as he focused on American history, anthropology, and ethnic studies at Wesleyan in Connecticut. Soon after graduating, he moved to Shanghai to travel, and has been working with 2K Games since they set up their local studio in 2006.<br/>
