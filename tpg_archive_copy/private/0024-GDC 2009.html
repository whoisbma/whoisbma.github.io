<p>Just returned from GDC in San Francisco.  It was incredibly beautiful out there, and I got to spend some quality time with family as well.  <br/>

</span><br/>
</div><br/>
<br/>
Made me think: why did I move to the east coast again?<br /><br/>
<br /><br/>
Highlights from the conference itself:<br /><br/>
   - making new and meeting old friends/contacts<br /><br/>
   - booth crawl (free beer!),<br /><br/>
   - the Harmonix Rock Band bar night (open bar!)<br /><br/>
<br /><br/>
I suppose it is worth noting that two of three involved free alcohol.<br /><br/>
<br /><br/>
The conference itself was exhausting though and less fun, mostly because with my Expo pass I wasn't attending any fun talks.  I wouldn't have had time to anyway though as I was fairly busy discovering the true core of GDC, behind all the fervor... networking and schmoozing.<br /><br/>
<br /><br/>
Not that those are bad things.  Just a little tiring.  Hopefully I will have some rad talks to outline from future GDCs.<br/>
