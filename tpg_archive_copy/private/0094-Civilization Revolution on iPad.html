<p>About a year ago, we worked on the port of <a href="http://civilizationrevolution.com/iphone/">Civilization Revolution on iPhone</a>.  I worked mainly on pitching the game and developing some early interface and control design before taking a brief hiatus away from Shanghai.  <br/>

Everyone was very happy with the performance of the game - it sat at number 1 on the Paid Apps chart for quite a while and we also were number 9 on Apple's top selling iPhone games of the year in 2009.  It wasn't a perfect port in some ways but we managed to get Sid Meier's incredible game up on the platform, delivering it to a new audience.  We couldn't have done it without the great team here and the support from the rest of 2K and Firaxis especially.<br/>
<br/>
Once the iPad was announced, we were naturally excited about the idea about a port, so I and my producer started drafting concepts - and we were asked to do it about a month before launch - FOR launch.<br/>

<br/>
This meant about 4 weeks for porting - rather 3 weeks for development and 1 for testing - and we most likely wouldn't even get prototypes onsite at 2K China.  This ended up being exactly the case.<br/>

<br/>
After a crazy 4 weeks, and thanks to the teams at Novato, 2K West, Firaxis, and of course here in-house, we managed to make the launch.  Everybody did a great job and I want to say this publicly on Pretentious.  Updates to the game are coming soon.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone has feedback on the game that they'd like to get straight to the developers, please feel free to comment, I and the team would love to hear from you! <br/>
