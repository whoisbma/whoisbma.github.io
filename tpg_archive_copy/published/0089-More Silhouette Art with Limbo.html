<p><a href="http://www.playdeadgames.com/">Playdead</a> just announced that <a href="http://www.limbogame.org/">Limbo</a> is headed to XBLA.  Looking forward to seeing this at GDC.<br/>

Limbo looks fantastic, and there's something just so archetypally elegant about that little stroll in the woods; its evocative of Miyamoto's childhood hillside wanderings, and my own memories of the intersections of exploration and imagination.<br/>
<br/>
Are atmospheric silhouette graphics all that it takes to impress me these days?  I think no - Feist and Limbo in particular look to be particularly subtle and refined in gameplay and sound as well - but there still is something to be said for simplicity of visuals taking such a strong position in the indie community now.  <br/>
<br/>
If players are appreciating visual subtlety in games more and more, that's a great thing - but will the pendulum swing away from it?  As Dejobaan Games' Ichiro Lambe <a href="http://www.gamesetwatch.com/2010/03/road_to_the_igf_dejobaans_lamb.php">recently said on GameSetWatch</a> regarding their approach to visuals on <a href="http://www.dejobaan.com/aaaaa/">AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! -- A Reckless Disregard for Gravity</a>:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote>One of our tenets is to look closely at what the big studios do, then do the exact opposite.</blockquote><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is a stylistic as well as practical decision.  What happens if non-mainstream style is appropriated, to some extent, by the mainstream (as things often do with very near everything besides games)?  What's next?<br/>

<p>Very cool, did you see it at GDC?

By the way Brian, I am also a game designed in your part of the world - currently based in Taipei. Thinking of checking out the Shanghai scene though. I'll be over a few days next week (Apr 8-10) on holiday with my family, but also to check out what it might be like to live there. Do you like living in Shanghai?

<p>Hi Joe,
thanks for the comment!  I did have a chance to see it at GDC, it looked great.  Hopefully I'll have time to do some writing on post-GDC takeaways.  Good to connect with you on LinkedIn.  See you in Shanghai.</p>
