<h2>Portal 2 as platform?</h2>

<p>Like many others, I have been immersed in Portal 2 since it was released yesterday.  I absolutely loved the experience playing through single player mode and what I have seen of co-op thus far - the game serves as a strong reminder to why I want to dedicate my life to game creation.<br/>
<br/>
Now that the praise is out of the way, I was surprised and somewhat appalled at the inclusion of a Team Fortress 2-like microtransaction store within the game.   That is, the Portal 2 store allows players to pay real money (usually $1 to $5) for arguably meaningless aesthetic changes to the two robots used in the co-op campaign.   These changes include skins, hats, gestures (unique animations used by the robots in-game), and so on.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
At first I brushed off the addition of the store as Valve giving players an opportunity to "donate" additional money to the developer if they were so inclined (with a minor incentive).   However upon some reflection, this simple answer doesn't seem to make much sense.  Would enough players really be willing to pay real money to customize an avatar in a game that lasts under 5 hours (which also has relatively low replayability) to justify the effort of including a store system?  Is Valve banking on the gaming community's love of Portal 2 to simply make some extra revenue?<br/>
<br/>
Valve is known to be very business savvy while still greatly respecting their players. The only way I could picture the store being appreciated (and not scorned) by a large percentage of players is if Valve intends to add additional playable content... and lots of it.  Is the store a foundation for a turning Portal 2 into a platform of frequently updated, free content similar to Team Fortress 2?   By having the store built into the core of the game from launch, they are securing a slow-burning income model that could fund a team to consistently deliver content and support, the same model that has been proven to work with TF2.<br/>
<br/>
These conclusions could simply be my respect for Valve obfuscating a very clear money-grab, but I remain hopeful.</p>

<p>As I understand it an important part of the microtransaction model is going after a significant audience--built-in here obviously--to serendipitously locate that core who will pay for hats. Because while the vast majority of players aren't interested, a disproportunate fraction of the paying core are 'whales' who will buy every damn thing.

So it becomes a question of weighing the added-value of a store against the collective annoyance of what is arguably your real audience (who in some cases might actually be worth less to you on paper but without which it's impossible to locate that invisible paying core) which is almost unianimously annoyed by this stuff.

My suspicion here is that this is the start of a campaign by Valve to put a store in every damn place, with the intention of mitigating that irritation factor through familiarity, and they're leading with a game that's almost impossible not to love. That's why it doesn't seem to make sense, what with the apparently short multiplayer appeal and limited bling-showoffnessability of this thing and the fact that you can unlock most of the store just by playing anyway--they want to soften the blow for when it comes time to put polygonal earbuds and a pirate hat on Gordon.</p>
