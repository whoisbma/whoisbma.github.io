<p>While in Paris, we managed to check out the <a href="http://museogames.com/">Museogames exhibition</a> at the incredible <a href="http://www.arts-et-metiers.net/">Musée des Arts et Métiers</a> (Museum of Arts and Crafts).<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
The collection was a testament to careful preservation of the artifacts of the medium, and a statement on their cultural, artistic, and technical historical value - they "bear witness to the technical developments of their time; they have played an important role in our economic, social and cultural history and represent an essential link between the inventions that preceded them and those that were to come after them."  <br/>
<br/>
The show featured two collections brought together - an extensive, once private collection (over 1500 pieces) which was acquired by the museum, and that of <a href="http://mo5.com/">MO5.com</a>, an organization dedicated to "the preservation and public dissemination of digital heritage."<br/>
<br/>
The exhibition is finally closing on the 13th of March, so hopefully the photos after the break can give a sense of what it was like to be there.  <br/>

The first playable exhibit. Touchier and more sensitive than I remembered.<br/>

The Museogames exhibition was a strange contrast to the rest of the museum, which showcased the development of craft and science throughout the last several hundred years. Since my generation has grown up with games since the beginning, Museogames presented what was quite literally a walk down memory lane as I encountered products that I still own and remember countless details about - whether it was the state of the game business at the time, developer culture, the technological advances being made, gameplay innovation, commercialism, and so on. For me, this made visiting the exhibition a bit more about triggering nostalgia and reflection than anything else.<br/>
<br/>
Despite all the nostalgia, there are some bits that I am glad to leave in the past, such as Sega's holographic/FMV <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Traveler_(video_game)">Time Traveler arcade game</a>, thankfully held outside the main room. Immediate recognition and amusement quickly gave way to the realization that it was much harder on the eyes than I remembered.<br/>
<br/>
What I do wonder about however, is how the younger (and older) generations are able to approach an exhibit like this. Are post-2000 kids, who have been around as long as Halo, curious about how we got there - or do they get bored? Can my parents' or grandparents' generation appreciate the cultural and technological relevance of the medium in a new light?</p>
