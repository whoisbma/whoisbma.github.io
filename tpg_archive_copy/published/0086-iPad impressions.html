I am definitely impressed with some things (and less impressed with others), though I personally wouldn't buy one until perhaps the 2nd or 3rd generation.  That seems to be the trend for my purchasing of Apple products, anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Regarding the possibilities for the iPad as a gaming device... it seems there is major potential, although it may not be as attractive to developers as Apple would like.  Gamasutra had a good <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/26979/Analysis_The_iPad__Good_For_Gaming_.php">summary</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote>"...although Apple's official specs page simply lists "accelerometer," an Apple representative at the event told me the device's accelerometer will be able to detect tilting on both the X and Y axes, unlike the iPhone, unlocking true 3D control as a possibility, but this capability was not demonstrated."<br/>
</blockquote><br/>
<br/>
True 3D control?  Old school arcade turret games come to mind... <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote>"The iPad will be as big a crap shoot for developers as the iPhone is. Forstall promised "another goldrush" when the iPad launches. But that promise, rather than exciting them, might make most developers a little queasy."</blockquote><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A bigger crapshoot, I'd say.  Especially within the first generation.<br/>
<br/>
Also ... still no Flash(!) - but Unreal Engine 3 on the other hand... the combination of low cost SDK/developer access and <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=25955">Unreal's free UE3 licensing plan</a> is an explosion of UE3 content waiting to happen, provided it sees support for non-PC dev.<br/>
<br/>
Having spent some time designing for user interaction and interface on the <a href="http://www.civilizationrevolution.com/iphone/">Civilization Revolution iPhone/iPod Touch</a> port here, I'm pretty excited to see the beta SDK for iPad roll out...  I want to see the capacity for multitouch recognition.  Two players simultaneously?  Four?  </p>
