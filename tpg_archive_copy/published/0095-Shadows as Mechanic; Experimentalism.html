<p>This talk on experimental games and Shadow Physics is a year old, but its worth revisiting.<br/>

<blockquote><a href="http://www.steveswink.com/posts/on-the-experimental-game-design-methodology/">"...it felt like "experimental" was starting to mean something dangerously specific. It meant finding a unique, promising mechanic dealing with spatial perception, imaginary physics, time manipulation, or some combination of the three and trying to squeeze all the possible interesting permutations of interactivity out of that one unique mechanic. Time, space, sound, color, structure. The criteria seems to be innovation as a mind-expanding riff on physics, and the games can almost always be seen as an attempt to answer one or two interesting questions as fully and satisfyingly as possible. And then culling the cruft."</a><br/>

Is it so possible to shut into a box what "experimental" means for games?  <br/>
<br/>
If so - couldn't an experimental game push the boundaries of what we consider a game at all?  Something that pushes against the definitions of given categories and expectations we have for them - something more than just incorporating unorthodox or non-mainstream elements? <br/>
<br/>
What makes an unorthodox element?  Swink says that most experimental games toy with our core notions of reality and how it behaves - and thus how we expect things should behave in a simulated environment.  Don't all games do this, to some extent?  <br/>
<br/>
The question seems to be simply how far does it go - that is, does the sense of reality in the simulated environment match what FEELS appropriate once we're immersed, regardless of whether or not our sense of what feels right IS right - and how central is the unexpected behavior to the game mechanics?  <br/>
<br/>
Portal, Braid and Shadow Physics all make use of a simulated reality that runs strongly contrary to that of our own experience - but still make sense and are consistent, once a mental check and adjustment is made.  <br/>
<br/>
Mario and Sonic make use of representations of characters and elements that also run strongly contrary to our own experience in reality, but we don't see it as experimental.  With a Fire Flower I can shoot a fireball out of my hand... and through the water no less.  However this isn't the central mechanic, and isn't violating a principle of reality as core to us as the idea that time moves only forward.<br/>
<br/>
Is a truly experimental game a <strong><a href="http://notgames.org/">not-game</a></strong>?  Most experimental games are all still games after all - systems of rules, meaningful decision-making, winning, losing, progressing.<br/>
<br/>
There seems to be a split between what people consider experimental - one side looking at unusual/brain-bending game mechanics, but still couched firmly within the framework of "gamey" principles - and the other looking at more experiential interactive experiences aiming for immersion, but not being games per se.<br/>
<br/>
What would be a non-digital experimental game?<br/>
