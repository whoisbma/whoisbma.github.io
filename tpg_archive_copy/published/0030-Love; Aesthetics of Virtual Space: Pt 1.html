<h2>Love; Aesthetics of Virtual Space: Pt 1</h2>

<p>The announcement of <a href="http://www.quelsolaar.com/love/index.html">Love</a> is exciting to me on many levels.  <br/>
<br/>
A game that is as freeform and open to personal innovation as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_Fortress">Dwarf Fortress</a> that takes place in a dynamic public place shared with friends and strangers is very compelling. You would have the ability to work with friends to test the limits of the toolset and your imagination while simultaneously being able to be inspired by other citizens' creations and methodology.  <br/>
<br/>
The fact that Love is the brainchild of a single person is equally inspiring and leads me to appreciate the product even more.  <br/>
<br/>
However, what I want to reflect on right now is the art style and how it resonates with an ever growing personal desire for videogames and their art direction.  <br/>

Love is a world built out of very simplistic 3D shapes and structures. However, by using tricks that involve complicated uses of "edge polygons" and alpha textures, the game distorts these simple shapes to be slightly more fluid and dynamic in their appearance. There are no hard edges - only skewed lines and somewhat blurry intersections.<br/>

<br/>
This effect in practice creates a very painterly landscape where the colors and shapes themselves have a sense of vibrancy; of life. As you move through the landscape it feels as if you are progressing through a 2D image or painting: the painting is changing as you move, instead of the sensation of you moving around a static, sterile 3D space.<br/>

<br/>
This somewhat new representation of a 3d space in a videogame sparked abstract discussions about the goals developers can have now that our technology has progressed to a sufficient level. For example, can we try and recreate how we view the world, rather than simply creating digital representations of objects existing in the world?  <br/>
<br/>
I'm going to muse a bit about this topic in my next post, <a href="http://www.thepretentiousgamer.com/?p=36">part 2</a>.</p>
